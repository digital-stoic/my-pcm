_If you think you understand quantum mechanics,  
you don’t understand quantum mechanics_

IBM Quantum Computer

Tens of billions of public and private capital are being invested in Quantum technologies. Countries across the world have realized that quantum technologies can be a major disruptor of existing businesses and change the balance of military power. So much so, that they have [collectively invested ~$24 billion in in quantum research](https://qureca.com/overview-on-quantum-initiatives-worldwide-update-mid-2021/) and applications.

At the same time, a week doesn’t go by without another story about a quantum technology milestone or another quantum company getting funded. Quantum has moved out of the lab and is now the focus of commercial companies and investors. In 2021 venture capital funds invested over $2 billion in 90+ Quantum technology companies. Over a [$1 billion of it going to Quantum computing](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/quantum-computing-venture-capital-funding) companies. In the last six months quantum computing companies [IonQ](https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2021-ionq-listed-on-nyse), [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/investors/) and [Rigetti](https://investors.rigetti.com/) went public at valuations close to a billion and half dollars. Pretty amazing for computers that won’t be any better than existing systems for at least another decade – or more.  So why the excitement about quantum?

### **The Quantum Market Opportunity**

While most of the IPOs have been in Quantum Computing, Quantum technologies are used in three very different and distinct markets: Quantum _Computing_, Quantum _Communications_ and Quantum _Sensing and Metrology_.[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/quantum-markets.jpg?resize=456%2C138&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/quantum-markets.jpg?ssl=1)

All of three of these markets have the _potential_ for being disruptive. In time Quantum _computing_ could obsolete existing cryptography systems, but viable commercial applications are still speculative. Quantum _communications_ could allow secure networking but are not a viable near-term business. Quantum _sensors_ could create new types of medical devices, as well as new classes of military applications, but are still far from a scalable business.

It’s a pretty safe bet that 1) the largest commercial applications of quantum technologies won’t be the ones these companies currently think they’re going to be, and 2) defense applications using quantum technologies will come first. 3) if and when they do show up they’ll destroy existing businesses and create new ones.

We’ll describe each of these market segments in detail. But first a description of some quantum concepts.

### _**Key Quantum Concepts**_

Skip this section if all you want to know is that 1) quantum works, 2) yes, it is magic.

**Quantum**  – The word “Quantum” refers to quantum mechanics which explains the behavior and properties of atomic or subatomic particles, such as electrons, neutrinos, and photons.

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/superposition.jpg?resize=62%2C57&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/superposition.jpg?ssl=1)Superposition** – quantum particles exist in many possible states at the same time. So a particle is described as a “superposition” of all those possible states. They fluctuate until observed and measured. Superposition underpins a number of potential quantum computing applications.

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/entaglement.jpg?resize=63%2C49&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/entaglement.jpg?ssl=1)Entanglement** – is what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” Two or more quantum objects can be linked so that measurement of one dictates the outcomes for the other, regardless of how far apart they are. Entanglement underpins a number of potential quantum communications applications.

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/observation.jpg?resize=57%2C55&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/observation.jpg?ssl=1)Observation –** Superposition and entanglement only exist as long as quantum particles are not observed or measured. If you observe the quantum state you can get information, but it results in the collapse of the quantum system.

**Qu[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/qubit-and-superposition-e1647572151870-300x223.jpg?resize=73%2C54&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/qubit-and-superposition.jpg?ssl=1)bit** – is short for a quantum bit. It is a quantum computing element that leverages the principle of superposition to encode information via one of four methods: spin, trapped atoms and ions, photons, or superconducting circuits.

_**Quantum Computers – Background**_

Quantum computers are a really cool idea. They harness the unique behavior of quantum physics—such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference—and apply it to computing.

In a classical computer transistors can represent two states – either a 0 or 1. Instead of transistors Quantum computers use quantum bits (called _qubits.) Qubits_ exist in _superposition_ – both in 0 and 1 state simultaneously.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Classic-vs-quantum-computers.jpg?resize=468%2C478&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Classic-vs-quantum-computers.jpg?ssl=1)

Classic computers use transistors as the physical building blocks of logic. In quantum computers they may use trapped ions, superconducting loops, quantum dots or vacancies in a diamond. The jury is still out.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Buidling-a-qubit.jpg?resize=468%2C244&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Buidling-a-qubit.jpg?ssl=1)

In a classic computer 2-14 transistors make up the seven basic logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, etc.) In a quantum computer building a single logical Qubit require a minimum of 9 but more likely 100’s or thousands of physical Qubits (to make up for error correction, stability, [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) and fault tolerance.)

In a classical computer compute-power increases linearly with the number of transistors and clock speed. In a Quantum computer compute-power increases exponentially with the addition of each logical qubit.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/physical-to-logical-qubit-1.png?resize=406%2C165&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/physical-to-logical-qubit-1.png?ssl=1)

But qubits have high error rates and need to be ultracold. In contrast classical computers have very low error rates and operate at room temperature.

Finally, classical computers are great for general purpose computing. But quantum computers can theoretically solve _some_ complex algorithms/ problems exponentially faster than a classical computer. And with a sufficient number of logical Qubits they can become a _Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer_ (CRQC).  And this is where Quantum computers become very interesting and relevant for both commercial and national security. (More below.)

### **Types of Quantum Computers**

Quantum computers could _potentially_ do things at speeds current computers cannot. Think of the difference of how fast you can count on your fingers versus how fast today’s computers can count. That’s the same order of magnitude speed-up a quantum computer could have over today’s computers for certain applications.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/quantum-computing.jpg?resize=431%2C217&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/quantum-computing.jpg?ssl=1)Quantum computers fall into four categories:

1.  Quantum Emulator/Simulator
2.  Quantum Annealer
3.  NISQ – Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum
4.  Universal Quantum Computer – which can be a _Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)_

When you remove all the marketing hype, the only type that matters is #4 – a Universal Quantum Computer. And we’re at least a decade or more away from having those.

_Quantum Emulator/Simulator  
_These are classical computers that you can buy today that simulate quantum algorithms. They make it easy to test and debug a quantum algorithm that someday may be able to run on a Universal Quantum Computer. Since they don’t use any quantum hardware they are no faster than standard computers.

_Quantum Annealer_ is a special purpose quantum computer designed to only run combinatorial optimization problems, _not_ general-purpose computing, or cryptography problems. [D-Wave](http://www.dwavesys.com/) has defined and owned this space. While they have more physical Qubits than any other current system they are not organized as gate-based logical qubits. Currently this is a nascent commercial technology in search of a future viable market.[  
](https://steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Four-Types-of-Quantum-computers.jpg)

[_Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum_](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/pdf/) (NISQ) computers. Think of these as _prototypes_ of a Universal Quantum Computer – with several orders of magnitude fewer bits. (They currently have 50-100 qubits, limited gate depths, and short coherence times.) As they are short several orders of magnitude of Qubits, NISQ computers cannot perform any useful computation, however they are a necessary phase in the learning, especially to drive total system and software learning in parallel to the hardware development. Think of them as the training wheels for future universal quantum computers.

_Universal Quantum Computers / Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQC)  
_This is the ultimate goal. If you could build a universal quantum computer with fault tolerance (i.e. millions of error corrected physical qubits resulting in thousands of logical Qubits), you could run quantum algorithms in cryptography, search and optimization, quantum systems simulations, and linear equations solvers. (See [here](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/) for a list of hundreds quantum algorithms.) These all would dramatically outperform classical computation on large complex problems that grow exponentially as more variables are considered. Classical computers can’t attack these problems in reasonable times without so many approximations that the result is useless. We simply run out of time and transistors with classical computing on these problems. These special algorithms are [what make quantum computers _potentially_ valuable](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04206.pdf). For example, [Grover’s algorithm](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/grovers-algorithm) solves the problem for the unstructured search of data. Further, quantum computers are very good at minimization / optimizations…think optimizing complex supply chains, energy states to form complex molecules, financial models, etc.

However, while all of these algorithms _might_ have commercial potential one day, no one has yet to come up with a use for them that would radically transform any business or military application. Except for one – and that one keeps people awake at night.

It’s [Shor’s algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q) for integer factorization – an algorithm that underlies much of existing public cryptography systems.

The security of today’s public key cryptography systems rests on the assumption that breaking into those with a thousand or more digits is practically impossible. It requires factoring into large prime numbers (e.g., RSA) or elliptic curve (e.g., ECDSA, ECDH) or finite fields (DSA) that can’t be done with any type of classic computer regardless of how large. [Shor’s factorization algorithm](https://interestingengineering.com/how-peter-shors-algorithm-dooms-rsa-encryption-to-failure) can crack these codes if run on a Universal Quantum Computer. Uh-oh!

**_Impact of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)_** Skip this section if you don’t care about cryptography.

Not only would a Universal Quantum Computer running Shor’s algorithm make today’s public key algorithms (used for asymmetric key exchanges and digital signatures) useless, someone can implement a “harvest-now-and-decrypt-later” attack to record encrypted documents now with intent to decrypt them in the future. That means everything you send encrypted today will be able to be read retrospectively. Many applications – from ATMs to emails – would be vulnerable—unless we replace those algorithms with those that are “quantum-safe”.

When Will Current Cryptographic Systems Be Vulnerable?

The good news is that we’re nowhere near having any viable Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer, now or in the next few years. However, you can estimate when this _will_ happen by calculating how many logical Qubits are needed to run [Shor’s Algorthim](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/shors-algorithm) and how long it will it take to break these crypto systems. There are lots of people tracking these numbers (see [here](https://globalriskinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-MOSCA-Quantum-Risk-February-Report-V2.pdf) and [here](https://globalriskinstitute.org/publications/2021-quantum-threat-timeline-report/)). Their estimate is that using 8,194 logical qubits using 22.27 million physical qubits, it would take a quantum computer 20 minutes to break RSA-2048. The best estimate is that this might be possible in 8 to 20 years.

_Post-Quantum / Quantum-Resistant Codes_

That means if you want to protect the content you’re sending now, you need to migrate to new Post-Quantum /Quantum-Resistant Codes. But there are three things to consider in doing so:

1.  **[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Migration-time.png?resize=425%2C142&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Migration-time.png?ssl=1)shelf-life time**: the number of years the information must be protected by cyber-systems
2.  **migration time**: the number of years needed to properly and safely migrate the system to a quantum-safe solution
3.  **threat timeline**: the number of years before threat actors will be able to break the quantum-vulnerable systems

These new cryptographic systems would secure against both quantum and conventional computers and can interoperate with existing communication protocols and networks. The symmetric key algorithms of the [Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite](https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iad-initiatives/cnsa-suite.cfm) were selected to be secure for national security systems usage even if a CRQC is developed.

Cryptographic schemes that commercial industry believes are quantum-safe include [lattice-based cryptography, hash trees](https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/NSAs-Cybersecurity-Perspective-on-Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Algorithms/), multivariate equations, and super-singular isogeny elliptic curves.

Estimates of when you can actually buy a fully error-corrected quantum computers vary from “never” to somewhere between 8 to 20 years from now. (Some optimists believe even earlier.)

### **Quantum Communication**

Quantum communications **≠** quantum computers. A quantum network’s value comes from its ability to distribute entanglement. These communication devices manipulate the quantum properties of photons/particles of light to build Quantum Networks.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-comm-mkt.jpg?resize=468%2C230&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-comm-mkt.jpg?ssl=1)This market includes secure quantum key distribution, clock synchronization, random number generation and networking of quantum military sensors, computers, and other systems.

_Quantum Cryptography/Quantum Key Distribution  
_Quantum Cryptography/Quantum Key Distribution can distribute keys between authorized partners connected by a quantum channel and a classical authenticated channel. It can be implemented via fiber optics or free space transmission. China transmitted entangled photons (at one pair of entangled particles per second) over 1,200 km in a satellite link, using the [Micius satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Experiments_at_Space_Scale).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-key-distribution.jpg?resize=249%2C98&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-key-distribution.jpg?ssl=1)The Good: it can detect the presence of an eavesdropper, a feature not provided in standard cryptography. The Bad: Quantum Key Distribution can’t be implemented in software or as a service on a network and cannot be easily integrated into existing network equipment. It lacks flexibility for upgrades or security patches. Securing and validating Quantum Key Distribution is hard and it’s only one part of a cryptographic system.

The view from the National Security Agency (NSA) is that quantum-resistant (or post-quantum) cryptography is a more cost effective and easily maintained solution than quantum key distribution. _NSA does not support the usage of QKD or QC to protect communications in National Security Systems_. (See [here](https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/Quantum-Key-Distribution-QKD-and-Quantum-Cryptography-QC/).) They do not anticipate certifying or approving any Quantum Cryptography/Quantum Key Distribution security products for usage by [National Security System](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/national_security_system) customers unless these limitations are overcome. However, if you’re a commercial company these systems may be worth exploring.

_Quantum Random Number Generators (GRGs)  
_Commercial Quantum Random Number Generators that use quantum effects (entanglement) to generate nondeterministic randomness are available today. (Government agencies can already make quality random numbers and don’t need these devices.)

Random number generators will remain secure even when a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer is built.

### **Quantum Sensing and Metrology**

Quantum sensors **≠** Quantum computers.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-sensing.jpg?resize=468%2C237&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quantum-sensing.jpg?ssl=1)This segment consists of Quantum _Sensing_ (quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, …), Quantum _Timing_ (precise time measurement and distribution), and Quantum _Imaging_ (quantum radar, low-SNR imaging, …) Each of these areas can create entirely new commercial products or entire new industries e.g. new classes of medical devices and military systems, e.g. anti-submarine warfare, detecting stealth aircraft, finding hidden tunnels and weapons of mass destruction. Some of these are achievable in the near term.

_Quantum Timing  
_First-generation quantum timing devices already exist as microwave atomic clocks. They are used in GPS satellites to triangulate accurate positioning. The Internet and computer networks use network time servers and the NTP protocol to receive the atomic clock time from either the GPS system or a radio transmission.

The next generation of quantum clocks are even more accurate and use laser-cooled single [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion) confined together in an electromagnetic ion trap. This increased accuracy is not only important for scientists attempting to measure dark matter and gravitational waves, but miniaturized/ more accurate atomic clocks will allow precision navigation in GPS- degraded/denied areas, e.g. in commercial and military aircraft, in tunnels and caves, etc.

_Quantum Imaging  
_Quantum imaging is one of the most interesting and near-term applications. First generation [magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer) such as [superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID) already exist. New quantum sensor types of imaging devices use entangled light, accelerometers, magnetometers, electrometers, gravity sensors. These allow measurements of frequency, acceleration, rotation rates, electric and magnetic fields, photons, or temperature with levels of extreme sensitivity and accuracy.

These new sensors use a variety of quantum effects: electronic, magnetic, or vibrational states or spin qubits, neutral atoms, or trapped ions. Or they use quantum coherence to measure a physical quantity. Or use quantum entanglement to improve the sensitivity or precision of a measurement, beyond what is possible classically.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ocean-topo.jpg?resize=228%2C196&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ocean-topo.jpg?ssl=1)Quantum Imaging applications can have immediate uses in archeology,  and profound military applications. For example, submarine detection using quantum magnetometers or satellite gravimeters could make the ocean transparent. It would compromise the survivability of sea-based nuclear deterrent by detecting and tracking subs deep underwater.

Quantum sensors and quantum radar from companies like [Rydberg](https://www.rydbergtechnologies.com/) can [be game changers](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2022/Cryospheric_Rydberg_Radar).

Gravimeters or quantum magnetometers could also detect concealed tunnels, bunkers, and nuclear materials. Magnetic resonance imaging could remotely ID chemical and biological agents. Quantum radar or LIDAR would enable extreme detection of electromagnetic emissions, enhancing ELINT and electronic warfare capabilities. It can use fewer emissions to get the same detection result, for better detection accuracy at the same power levels – even detecting stealth aircraft.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Gravity-cartography.jpg?resize=271%2C207&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Gravity-cartography.jpg?ssl=1)Finally, _Ghost imaging_ uses the quantum properties of light to detect distant objects using very weak illumination beams that are difficult for the imaged target to detect. It can increase the accuracy and lessen the amount of radiation exposed to a patient during x-rays. It can see through smoke and clouds. _Quantum illumination_ is similar to ghost imaging but could provide an even greater sensitivity.

**National and Commercial Efforts  
**Countries across the world are making major investments [~$24 billion in 2021](https://qureca.com/overview-on-quantum-initiatives-worldwide-update-mid-2021/) – in quantum research and applications.
