# Notes
## What a community is (and isn’t)
One common misconception, I’ve noticed, is the idea that “community” and “customers” are synonymous terms. They aren’t. Understanding how they differ is critical, so let’s start there.
The people who interact with your product generally fall into one of four buckets: 
-   **Customers/users** buy and/or use your product. 
-   **Evangelists** tell everyone they know to buy or use your product because they genuinely love it.
-   **Community** is the group of people who’ve found belonging and utility through your product. 
-   **Ambassadors** are incentivized, through payments or rewards, to promote your product.
## The quadrant, sequenced  
Three of these groups reliably emerge in a fixed order: Users/customers come first, followed by evangelists, and then community.
Ambassadors don’t fit neatly into this sequence, so you’ll need to make a decision about their relationship to the other three groups. Even though ambassador endorsements aren’t organic, they still help spread awareness of your product to new segments and markets
One thing you shouldn’t do is waste engineering resources on building out your own community infrastructure. At this stage, third-party community platforms will meet all your technical needs. Plus, your target community members might already use them. Meeting people where they are never hurts.
The early days of community-building should feel like user research. You’re _not_ trying to build an audience or sustain engagement. Instead, you’re experimenting with different offerings to figure out what your evangelists want
## The community funnel: invited —> invested
Communities are primarily valuable to businesses for two reasons:
-   They create a built-in source of real-time user feedback, which is critical for building a product people really want.  
-   They foster friendships rooted in an affinity for your product, which drives lifetime value and new customer referrals.
