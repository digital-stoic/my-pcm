[description::Stoicism is not about eliminating emotions. It’s about minimizing negative emotions like stress and anxiety and anger. It’s not about accepting your powerlessness. It’s about taking power over all that is inside your control. Your attitudes. Your wants. Your desires. Your opinions about what has happened. Your happiness.]

# Notes
- What is Happiness? For the Stoic, therefore, happiness is the pursuit of virtue
- What Causes Unhappiness? “It is not the man who has too little but the man who craves more, that is poor.” Seneca
- What Did The Stoics Say About Happiness? What the Stoics were after was the ability to be fully content with life. Can you bravely face what life has in store from one day to the next, can you bounce back from every kind of adversity without losing a step, can you be a source of strength and inspiration to others around you?
- Focus On What You Can Control: Put your best efforts into the tasks in front of you today. Take care of the inputs and detach from the outcomes. Don’t worry about what might happen later
- Do Good To Feel Good: Think less of your problems and try to help others with theirs
- Journal: The true path to happiness is not through externals. It’s found within. It’s found in the stillness. In the quiet. With yourself and a journal
- Take A Walk: When you are stressed or overwhelmed at the office, take a walk in the parking lot. When you feel suffocated at home, take a walk around the neighborhood. Talk a walk first thing in the morning. Take a walk on your lunch break. Take a walk after dinner. See what it does for your happiness
- Do Less: If we could do less inessential stuff, we’d be able to better do what is essential. We’d also get a taste of that tranquillity that Marcus was talking about
- Take The Time To Be Grateful: ke some time today to stop, take a step back, and get a complete view—like that there are over a thousand people involved in making your morning cup of coffee possible. There’s a lot we take for granted. In every moment, there are limitless opportunities to say thanks. Take them!
- Connect With Others: We’re social beings! Our nature craves connection. The lack of connection is a poison to our happiness and well being just like cigarettes or alcohol. It poisons our minds. It poisons our relationships. It poisons our society. Step out of your bubble and engage, bond, connect. You will emerge in a great mood, guaranteed
- Strenuous Exercise
- Laugh
- Let Go Of Worry, Anxiety, and Regret
- Realize: You Have Everything You Need: What you must realize today is that you already have everything you need to be happy. You are already rich. You already have an incredible power—the power to determine your own needs and desires, the ability to say enough. That magical word: enough. The happy life will never be determined by external things. No amount is enough for one who has too little, the Stoics said. Meanwhile, the person who can be grateful, who can direct their thoughts properly—towards what is good in this life—will be happy in any and every situation
