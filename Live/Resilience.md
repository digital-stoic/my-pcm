### Notes
The trades and occupations that continue to exist will be much less numerous, less varied and specialized than those we see today. They will be determined by competence and concrete, immediately useful knowledge (most credentials and the “killer résumé” will cease to have much value). First of all, there will be the trades involving primary production:
fishing, agriculture, gardening, hunting, and gathering will be done by those who possess the know-how and the traditional tools, and who have no need of machines that require gasoline or oil;
the production of alcohol and drugs will be very lucrative, for persons used to those substances will be even more desperate than they are today, and a large part of the population will need to forget the trauma they have suffered;
stock breeders, trainers, shearers, and slaughterers of animals, as well as those in the food preparation trades—butchers, bakers, pastry makers—will flourish;
trades related to cereal production, such as milling, will once again be important.

Then, the trades related to caring for man and beast:
doctors or medical aides capable of treating the commonest illnesses, capable of carrying out surgical operations or treating wounds with massage or manipulation (sophisticated and efficient operating theaters will no longer be available, and neither will complicated medications);
midwives and obstetricians;
herbalists, botanists, old-fashioned pharmacists and other trades involving knowledge of medicinal plants, their effects, and how to apply them;
veterinarians who know how to care for animals and assist with their birth.

Among the most important trades will be those related to making and fixing tools, clothing, and machines:
artisans of all kinds, rope makers, saddlers, weavers, dyers, carpenters, ironworkers, glass blowers, potters, etc.;
metal workers, substitute part makers, machine makers, and repairmen;
solar-panel repairmen, wind-turbine repairmen, battery makers, and others concerned with sources of electricity;
masons and stonecutters, woodcutters and woodworkers, house builders, and repairmen.

Other trades will be those involving access to resources:
trades requiring knowledge of safe places (hiding places, grottos, etc.);
trades requiring knowledge of how to get access to water (well drillers, etc.);
trades involving managing access to natural resources that can be tapped through manual labor (getting old salt, coal, copper, and asphalt mines running);
trades involving knowing how to recuperate things of value and knowing where to find them (digging through abandoned villas and cities that have become open-air mines for materials, parts, etc.; this will require competence in cabinetmaking, scrap-iron working, masonry, as well as foremen to manage all these manual laborers and unskilled “hands” who help with the heavy lifting);
trades involving the knowledge of how to use hand tools.

Another important category will be educational trades, probably involving apprenticeship rather than intellectual training.

Itinerant trading involving boats, barges, or carts will probably be a dangerous profession, but very lucrative. Less risky will be markets that will be installed locally or regionally, where communities can exchange goods, parts, agricultural products, seeds, etc. All these trades, rare today, will surely be the salvation of those who can master them—at least insofar as they are not threatened by looters and thieves or put under the control of organized-crime syndicates. For this reason, another important category will be security trades: people able to ensure the safety of goods, tools, territories, and persons. Policemen, soldiers, prison guards, etc. will need a source of revenue and will use their skills by exercising violence, either by defending or attacking. (Some of them know how to create a need for their own profession: if you do not employ them to protect you, they will likely be the ones attacking you).

Undoubtedly, many other trades will also exist. But they will all be much more “primal,” much closer to the real sources of wealth, than today. It is imaginable that service professions will disappear—or be limited to prostitution, for example, which for many women may become the only means of survival, as was the case in the large cities of Europe throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. There will be no more office work, no more white-collar employees as productive units in long logistical chains of production. As for those unable to be useful in any special way, their only recourse will be physical labor; it will be very difficult and monotonous for former civil servants, marketing and communication strategists, accountants, bankers, lawyers, notaries, politicians, psychologists, academics, journalists, social workers, etc.

# A Few Basic Rules of Survival
## Notes
On all occasions, be here now
Look—and believe what you see. If it looks like something is dangerous, that’s because it most likely is dangerous
Avoid impulsive behavior. Think—do it quickly, but think
Remain calm and concentrated
Learn to control your breathing
Stay hydrated
Avoid or learn to control the four poisons of the mind: fear, confusion, hesitation, and surprise
Do not succumb to depression or defeatism
Have no fear of fear: fear is your friend, if you know how to master it
Set yourself small goals that you can achieve one by one. This will give you confidence
Believe in your chances of success, however small they may be
Learn to know yourself, your heart, and body
Learn to be realistic about your strengths and weaknesses
Learn to know your environment and the natural world around you
Learn to respect the laws of physics, the forces in nature: energy, speed, distance, mass. If you have doubts, listen to them
Learn from your mistakes and those of others
Have backbone, but be flexible, be firm but pragmatic, humble but determined
Do not let anyone or anything tame or break your spirit
Reflect, analyze, plan, be decisive, and make correct decisions
Do not put more energy in a task than the benefits you will gain from it
Celebrate your successes; learn to appreciate life and to be grateful for every little thing
Know how to see the beauty in each situation, in nature and those around you
If you believe in God(s), pray

# Sustainable Autonomous Base
## Notes
A Sustainable Autonomous Base is a secure space—this is what will be most scarce in the near future. . . . We must construct a sound economy, rather than a maximally productive one. It should be an economy of physical production geared toward stable and solid solutions, in contrast to our over-financialized, virtual economy solely preoccupied with profit. We want stability; we want the long term; we thus want rootedness. . . . We want to reconstruct autonomy, but also permanence. We want to see a future for ourselves and our children. We want a foundation, a ground, a base, a land. We want a true Sustainable Autonomous Base. A permanent base. Our motto: rootedness, autonomy, permanence. . . The political gesture is a foundation for mental and territorial rigidity. We demand this rigidity: it means that we will not bend, we will not bow.
