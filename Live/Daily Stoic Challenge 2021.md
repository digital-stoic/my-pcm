  Day 2: Stop A Backslide. Pick An Abandoned Resolution Back Up
  “When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.” — Marcus Aurelius
  
   
  
  
  Marcus Aurelius wasn’t perfect.
  
  
  With so many responsibilities competing for his time and attention, he was guilty, as we all have been, of letting a good habit slide. 
  
  
  Why would he remind himself to keep returning to philosophy if he didn’t occasionally find himself reverting to old ways and bad habits. Needing to remind himself to return to a simple diet because he caught himself overdoing it a little. To get up early and to get a move on his obligations after sleeping away one too many mornings. Why would he remind himself over and over again that he was made to work with other people, that a world without irritating and shameless people is impossible, that anger is never the answer if he didn’t lose his temper on his fellow man?
  
  
  Of course he needed reminders to re-engage with those good habits he let slack. All humans do. Despite our better judgment and best intentions, life has a nasty habit of getting in the way and sending us on accidental hiatuses from our hobbies, our (good) habits, and our resolutions. 
  
  
  Think back to this time last year. You were aiming to kick off 2020 with a number of goals and resolutions. 2020 was the year. You were going to learn spanish. You were going to quit smoking. You joined that crossfit gym. You were going to shed 5 pounds. You were going to read a book a week. You were going to pick up the guitar too.
  
  
  This went well right up until the middle of March. Your gym closed. Work got extra busy. Your home got extra hectic. Your free time got extra limited. And now, well, here we are, almost ten months into a pandemic. You put on 5 pounds. You got through dozens of shows but not a single book. You haven’t picked up the guitar, you haven’t put down the cigarettes, y no habla espanol. 
  
  
  So before we get ahead of ourselves this year with more goals and resolutions, we’re going to go back, see what went wrong, and pick up where we left off. We stopped getting up early enough to get a workout in before work. We cut practicing that instrument or learning that language to concentrate our time and energy elsewhere. We lost motivation to read before bed and opted instead for Netflix. We missed a few days of journaling or running or eating the way we’d like and get better and better at making excuses to miss another and another and another. 
  
  
  Maybe we start to feel guilty or even ashamed about it. Maybe we say it’s proof that we can’t stick to that diet or that workout routine or that guitar practice schedule. Maybe we reach a point where we think we might as well just hang it up for good, abandon it entirely. 
  
  
  What we should do is what Marcus said,
  
  “Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.”
  
  Today, after you celebrate behaving like a human, pick one of those habits you have let fall to the wayside–it could be from this past year, it could be from many years past–and commit to returning to it. 
  
  
  Try what Marcus liked to do. He didn’t just pick something at random. He chose something meaningful, then reminded himself why he should practice it, why it was important to him and the person he aspired to be. 
  
  
  He reminded himself that he was a better leader, father, husband, human when he made time for reading philosophy and attending lectures. He reminded himself how his mentor and role model Antoninus kept a simple diet so he could serve his people better and for longer. He reminded himself that getting out of bed early and into his duties was the defining characteristic of productive human beings and the necessary antecedent to living the good life. 
  
  
  One of the purposes of studying philosophy, the Stoics said, is to become more aware of what you want to do and why you want to do it. Seneca, for instance, liked to say that philosophy isn’t a parlor trick. If one’s motivation is wanting to sound smarter at this bar or that party, he said, it won’t take long for them to abandon their studies. The motivation has to be rooted more deeply. 
  
  
  It’s important in this moment, however, not to get lost in over-thinking, in self-evaluation and self-flagellation. Analysis paralysis is the last place you want to be when you are reckoning with a good habit that you know you’ve let slide and all you want is simply to get back on the right track with it. To re-engage with the person we know we can be, to make progress in that positive direction, simply requires that we act. 
  
  
  Action. Action is something we decide. Action, we can control. Action, when repeated day in and day out, is what turns hope into habit, and makes that habit part of us. The best version of us.
  
  
  Dr. Clare Carlisle Tresch, author of the award-winning book On Habit, talked about this when we interviewed her a little while back. The habit—whatever it is—has to become a part of you, she said. “The Stoics were so important not only because they recognized the force of habit,” she said, “but because they devised practical techniques, or exercises, for living well with habits. And they approached philosophy as a way of life, not just a theoretical discipline, and that’s a conception of philosophy I really value.”
  
  
  We talked about it yesterday—the Stoic works to optimize that which is in our control. The backslide—that is in the past. It’s out of your control. But recovering, getting back on track—that is in your control. Last September, the actor Dax Shepard opened up on his podcast about relapsing sixteen years of sobriety. He admitted that he did consider not going public with it, that his ego really liked hearing and really wanted to keep saying, ‘I’m sixteen years sober.’ He titled the episode “Day 7”—he was celebrating that “today, I have seven days.”
  
  
  The path to self-improvement is rocky—tripping and sliding are inevitable. You’ll forget to do the push-ups, you’ll cheat on your diet, you’ll get sucked into the rabbit hole of Twitter, or you’ll give in to the urge after sixteen years of resisting it. That’s okay. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. The Stoics would have liked this advice from Oprah: If you catch yourself eating an Oreo, don’t beat yourself up; just try to stop before you eat the whole sleeve. Don’t turn a slip into a catastrophic fall. And a couple of centuries before her, Marcus Aurelius said something similar:
  
  
  When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstance, revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better group of harmony if you keep on going back to it.
  
  
  In other words, when you mess up, get back on track as soon as you can. Don’t quit or beat yourself up just because you’re not perfect. Instead, celebrate having behaved like a human. Celebrate day 1 and day 7 and day 700.

  Day 3: Unplug: Spend The Day On Airplane Mode
  “His life will be like that of Jupiter, who, amid the dissolution of the world, when the gods are confounded together and Nature rests for a space from her work, can retire into himself and give himself over to his own thoughts. In some such way as this the sage will act; he will retreat into himself, and live with himself.” — Seneca, Letters, 9.16 
  
  “It is the part of a wise man to resist pleasures,” Epictetus said, “but of a foolish man to be a slave to them.”
  
  
  Have you heard of phantom pocket vibration syndrome? People are so addicted to their phones and so desperate for the dopamine hits from every text message, from every notification of a like or a share or a heart or a retweet, that we actually experience auditory and tactile hallucinations that our phones are ringing.
  
  
  Or how about nomophobia? It’s that feeling when you can’t find your phone or you forgot it or it’s about to run out of battery or you’re without service. It’s another psychological condition spawned by smartphone technology in the 21st century from which studies have shown nearly two-thirds of the population suffers.  The symptoms include anxiety, stress, panic, respiratory alterations, trembling, perspiration, agitation, disorientation, and tachycardia (an abnormal, increased heart rate).
  
  
  Now, add 2020 to that cocktail of cognitive torment. Months and months of doomscrolling Twitter when we wake up and before we go to bed. Weeks and weeks of refreshing Johns Hopkins’ Covid-19 online dashboard–what the Drudge Report has labeled the “World Sick Map”–for up-to-date case figures, hospitalization numbers, death counts. Days and days this past November of cycling between news sites and cable channels on an endless loop searching for updated vote totals, electoral college projections, recount demands.
  
  
  All of it is so utterly, overwhelmingly exhausting. A ride that began in a quest for regular dopamine hits, accelerated under the pressure of a fire-hose of cortisol, until it began to spin so fast it felt like we couldn’t get off. We couldn’t unplug.
  
  
  Today’s challenge requires you to do just that. Use this the first Sunday of 2021 to unplug, to spend the day without your devices. Switch your phone to airplane mode. Give it to your partner to hold for the day. Put it in your dresser. Lock it in the glove box of your car. Wherever. Just put a full 24 hours between you and your phone.
  
  
  See what life is like untethered. Free of the digital dopamine drip of likes and shares and retweets and hearts and pings and notifications. A drip that is not just a distraction but, with the mayhem of the last year, is also an ambush of cortisol that is frying our brains and distorting our perception of the world. What you will find if you do this is that your life is not going to fall apart because you are out of pocket for an extended period of time. Those urgent calls and texts and emails and news alerts and tweets aren’t really so urgent after all.
  
  
  Though the ancient world was free of smartphones, it was full of distractions and cheap pleasures and all kinds of chatter and activity and temptation. The Stoics wouldn’t have prized temperance or moderation as one of their four cardinal virtues if it was easy to abstain from gossip or following the mob or chasing external validation or letting the mind be jerked by every impulse. They wouldn’t have worked so hard to gain control over their minds if there weren’t external forces constantly trying to steal some of that control. They wouldn’t have written so much about the shortness of life if they didn’t see people wasting so much precious time. Marcus Aurelius wouldn’t have talked about retreating into the soul, Seneca wouldn’t have written about his struggles to sit alone with his thoughts, and Epictetus wouldn’t have considered those free of compulsion “the gods’ equal” if disconnecting and unplugging and being present weren’t really, really hard.
  
  
  It’s one of the nice things about being on a plane. Or at least it used to be until the gods of distraction found their way to 35,000 feet. Air travel forced us to disconnect and unplug and be present. It was one of the few places where nothing can get to you. Where you were unreachable. Where you got some uninterrupted time with your own thoughts. Where you could stare out the window for hours, disconnecting from the world and reconnecting with yourself.
  
  
  That’s the kind of experience we want to create today. It’s not just about minimizing smartphone usage. It’s also about getting reacquainted with yourself and the physical world as it is, not as the digital world would have us believe it to be.
  
  
  When we interviewed Arianna Huffington, she told us that she has Marcus’ inner-retreat quote laminated in her wallet, on her desk, and on her night stand. “It perfectly illustrates the current moment,” she elaborated, “the only way to find peace and thrive is to take breaks from the world and make time to regularly renew ourselves by reconnecting with ourselves.”
  
  
  That it comes from one of the Titans of Digital Media is worth emphasizing.
  
  
  Similarly, when we interviewed computer scientist and author Cal Newport, he explained some of the reasons he advocates for “digital minimalism” and why so many of us have become powerless to the pull of our screens. Mainly, he says, it’s the manipulation that is the problem. The other really smart computer scientists specifically engineered these devices and social media platforms to foster compulsive behavior. “The ‘like’ button wasn’t introduced for your benefit,” Cal said, “it was instead introduced for the benefits of the early Facebook investors who were getting antsy for their 100x return.”
  
  
  Indeed, there’s hardly anything about the smartphone that is there for our benefit:
  
  A study from the University of Chicago published in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research found that the presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance.
  Another study conducted by behavioral scientists at the University of Arizona found that smartphone dependency predicts greater risk of depression and loneliness.
  Surgeons at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles published a study in The Spine Journal that showed posture-related injuries from smartphone use are increasing. It’s an epidemic they call “text neck.” When standing upright, the average head places 10 to 12 pounds of force on the cervical spine, but just a 15-degree tilt increases that weight to 27 pounds, and a 60-degree one to 60 pounds. The extra spine stress can lead to earlier wear and tear on your spine, and even require surgery in the worst cases.
  
  If the day is to be spent unplugged, the obvious question is what should you do with that time? With that three to four and a half hours—according to the data—most of us spend on our phones?
  
  
  The answer from the ancient world might surprise you. You should use that time for leisure, they’d say. But not the lounging around, doing nothing kind of leisure. No, in the ancient world, leisure meant scholé. School. But not the get good grades and get ahead kind of school. No, in the ancient world, it meant learning and study and the pursuit of higher things to enrich one’s soul and spirit.
  
  
  Seneca writing thoughtful letters to friends. Zeno gathering at the Stoa Poikile to discuss ideas in the continual pursuit of living a better life. Marcus attending philosophical lectures and sitting down to reflect in his journal.
  
  
  To the man, this was leisure, leisure, leisure.
  
  
  In his essay Leisure, the Basis of Culture, Josef Pieper wrote, “Leisure is a form of that stillness that is necessary preparation for accepting reality; only the person who is still can hear, and whoever is not still, cannot hear…Leisure is the disposition of perceptive understanding, of contemplative beholding, and immersion — in the real.”
  
  
  In How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, Arnold Bennett argues for using leisure time to stretch the mind with some “serious reading” of books that produce “the feeling of strain, of difficulty, of a task which one part of you is anxious to achieve and another part of you is anxious to shirk.”
  
  
  So that is your job today, to follow Marcus Aurelius’s advice to carve out “some leisure time…and stop bouncing around.” And to follow Seneca’s advice to be careful that the things we own don’t end up owning us. We have to question anything we can’t stop checking or doing or spending time on. As Musonius Rufus said, we have to be wary of anything we do out of “thoughtless habit.”
  
  
  When the ancients, Media Titans, and computer scientists all agree—we’d be foolish not to listen. Spend the day without your device. Enjoy some real leisure. Unplug from the digital world and reconnect with the world of ideas. Consider yourself “the gods’ equal.”

  Day 4: Double Down. Pick The Best Change You Made In 2020 And Push Further
  “Everywhere means nowhere…Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about.” — Seneca, Letters From A Stoic, 2.2-3
  
  You dropped some balls over the last twelve months. There were some resolutions you didn’t follow through on. But the year wasn’t without its gains either.
  
  
  Each of us did a lot right. Or a few things right. It’s impossible that you didn’t do one thing right.
  
  
  You made changes in 2020. External circumstances outside your control almost certainly required you to.
  
  
  Maybe your diet improved because your go-to fast casual restaurants were shut down. Maybe you read more books in the last ten months than you did in the last ten year years. Maybe you started jogging because you were desperate for any way to spend some time out of the house. Maybe you found Stoicism.
  
  
  Your challenge today is to pick one of those positive changes you made and push it even further.
  
  
  Maybe you started cooking and have never felt healthier. Take it to the next level with a cooking course or a book like The 4-Hour Chef. If it’s jogging—start to add in some strength training: push-ups, pull-ups, planks, lunges, and so on. If it’s Stoicism, if you’ve been reading The Daily Stoic book and emails every morning—it’s time for journaling, for writing and reflecting and meditating on your own thoughts by articulating them into maxims and aphorisms you can hold yourself to.
  
  
  Whatever the change, whatever it is you started doing, your challenge is to invest more into it. That could be a monetary investment. You might buy some weights to augment your new exercise routine. It could be an investment of time. With your new habit of going for a walk every morning, you might push the thirty minutes to an hour. It could be an investment of energy. With your new reading habit, you might commit to taking notes as you read and then transferring those notes to a commonplace book.
  
  
  It’s the old adage—you may remember it from headlines back in 2011 when Larry Page took over as CEO at Google: Putting more wood behind fewer arrows. Focus, prioritization, quality not quantity, less not more—that’s how the greats become great, whether you’re talking about a person or a company.
  
  
  Apple provides us with another good case study. In 1996, Steve Jobs returned as CEO after being ousted over a decade earlier. The first thing he did was cut 70% of Apple’s product line. His daughter said it was a business decision that reflected his life philosophy. “He believed that great harvests came from arid sources, pleasure from restraint,” she explained. “He knew the equations that most people didn’t know: Things led to their opposites.”
  
  
  The Stoics knew and lived those equations too. Seneca talked about how discursive so many people are. They think they need to do it all and end up doing hardly anything. He compared it to the way people behave at a banquet. They can’t help themselves from trying everything. But ask them a few days later what they ate at the banquet and they can’t remember. Everywhere means nowhere, he liked to say. “It is the sign of an overnice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish.”
  
  
  There’s never been a greater temptation to be everywhere, to try everything, than right now. Our world is overflowing with information and opportunity. This could be a good thing, but more often than not, it leads to discursiveness, to distraction, to diffusion. The solution is, as Robert Greene dubbed the 23rd Law of Power, to concentrate your forces. This is the real value of the current minimalism movement: it’s not that there is something inherently better about living like an ascetic, it’s that having to manage less means you have more time, energy, money and focus to do the things that matter to you. It helps you put more wood behind fewer arrows.
  
  
  When we had Cal Newport on the podcast to talk about how to stay productive and adopt or maintain good habits in the middle of a pandemic, he talked about the importance of doubling down from a psychological standpoint. He called it “taking a big swing.” It’s a psychological cue, a signal to your brain that says, ‘we take this seriously, we do this everyday—rain, snow, sleet, or global pandemic.’ Cal compared it to that fitness nut who has a crazy supplement routine, an infrared sauna, a garage converted into a crossfit box. Doesn’t it seem a little unnecessary, a little unreasonable? Do the supplements even work? These questions miss the point, Cal said, it’s the psychological signaling. And, to be fair, they are fitter than you and I.
  
  
  Take a big swing today. Something that seems borderline unreasonable, a little unnecessary. Order bookshelves and convert the guest room into your home library. Upgrade your blender to a high powered Vitamix or your stationary bike to a Peloton. Hire a running coach, get the new GPS watch, adopt that fitness nut’s supplement routine.
  
  
  In his book Cadence, Pete Williams tells the story of a bike shop owner who turns around his flailing business with the 10% Wins strategy. 10% improvements across just seven categories, Williams showed, produce a doubling of total profits in the aggregate.
  
  
  Whatever the change is and however you decide to take it further, just remember it’s a law: concentrate your forces. Cut your product line. Put more wood behind fewer arrows. Invest more money, time, and energy in fewer things. Take the big swing, for a better you and the best life you can live.

  Day 5: Empower 3 People To Give You Honest Feedback
  “Be careful not to rashly refuse to learn from others.” — Cato The Elder
  
  Marcus Aurelius didn’t want to be emperor. That was “the essential tragedy of Marcus Aurelius,” biographer Frank McLynn wrote. He wanted to be a philosopher. He was reclusive and bookish by nature. He was earnestly reticent. When he learned he had been adopted by the emperor Hadrian and would be made emperor, he was saddened. Unlike most princes, Marcus didn’t look at the throne and see power and fame and wealth. He saw a really, really hard job. He knew that no one man could do that job well. So, like all great heroes, he broke the mold.
  
  
  He filled his court with brilliant public servants. Though he did not particularly like him, he hired his childhood tutor Fronto because he was unquestionably the greatest rhetorician of the time. Though Junius Rusticus was famously hard on his pupil (Marcus relates he was “often upset with Rusticus”), Marcus immediately elevated him to major roles within his court. Marcus later wrote that of all the good fortune the gods gave him, having Rusticus in his life was the greatest. And, though his ego could be frustrating at times, Marcus hired Galen, the most famous physician and polymath of antiquity because he wanted to raise “the intellectual tone” of his court.
  
  
  As McLynn explains, Marcus’ “shrewd and careful personnel selection is worthy of study by any person in any position, leadership or otherwise. He had no ego. He surrounded himself with talent, not aristocrats or cronies. He empowered people to give him advice, to speak up when they saw a better way for things to be done.
  
  
  It was not just a leadership philosophy. Like all the Stoics, there were few philosophers Marcus admired more than Socrates, who believed that an awareness of what one doesn’t know is a mark of intelligence. Sometimes, it’s impossible to reach that kind of awareness on our own. We all have biases and blindspots—conscious and unconscious. We need people to reveal those for us.  We need people to serve as a check on our thinking, our behavior, our decision making. As Marcus wrote,
  
  
  “If anyone can refute me—show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective—I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.”
  
  
  It’s hard to take feedback. It can feel like being under attack. We get suspicious of the person who gives it. They’ve always had it out for me. We get defensive. No, no, you’re misunderstanding me. Or offensive. What does that idiot know, anyways? It’s hard to give feedback too. Especially in today’s world where everything seems to have the potential to offend. It’s a tightrope. Even the well-intentioned hold their tongue.
  
  
  Which is why it’s no longer enough to be receptive to feedback. You have to make it known. You have to give others the greenlight. You have to, like Marcus, empower people to give you a full accounting.
  
  
  That’s your challenge today: to empower 3 people to give you the kind of honest feedback we all require, to reveal your blindspots, to show you when your thinking or judgment or perspective could be improved.
  
  
  It’s critical that you do this.
  
  
  The inability to take and listen to feedback has destroyed a lot of talented people. We need look no further than Marcus’ own son Commodus who, despite some good qualities, spiraled out of control like so many emperors who preceded him. There was Domitian, there was Nero, there was Caligula before him, and then Tiberius before him. They all shared one thing in common, which the great ancient Roman historian Cassius Dio illustrated it in microcosm when describing the key contrast between Commodus and Marcus.
  
  
  “[Commodus was] the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature. And this, I think, Marcus clearly perceived beforehand. Commodus was nineteen years old when his father died, leaving him many guardians, among whom were numbered the best men of the senate. But their suggestions and counsels Commodus rejected.”
  
  
  Commodus “was not naturally wicked,” Dio explains, “but, on the contrary, as guileless as any man that ever lived.” This innocent young man became a monster because he thought he could succeed alone. Marcus actually said it—only beasts can do this life thing alone. Or think they can. As for the rest of us? We need help. We need people who can challenge, provoke, and spur us forward. People who can hold us accountable to the principles, practices, and good habits we aspire to live by.
  
  
  The organizational psychologist and bestselling author Adam Grant calls it a “challenge network”—the group of people who tell you what you need to hear. The network part is worth emphasizing. Just as we have our biases and blindspots, our potential advisors do too. So we don’t want to just find the smartest and wisest person we know. Instead, we want to think about filling our network the way Marcus filled his court—strategically. Marcus appointed people with specific areas of expertise. We imagine Marcus went to the great rhetorician Fronto for diplomatic matters, the great physician Fronto for all things concerned with the Antonine plague, and the great philosopher Rusticus for general life and leadership guidance.
  
  
  In your challenge network, you want to be able to get feedback from varying sources for varying aspects of your life. Maybe one person who is where you want to be in your career. One where you want to be as a spouse or a parent. One where you want to be as a leader or a thinker or just a well-rounded individual. If the idea of a challenge network feels a little too squishy or esoteric, think of it like a personal board of directors whose job is to give it to you straight and to whom you have chosen to make yourself accountable.
  
  
  In practice, there are a number of ways to go about getting feedback but the key is to be specific. When Grant guest lectures, for instance, he’ll have the audience fill out a feedback form with two simple questions: “How can I improve?” And “Is there anything that I did well, that I should try to repeat or build on?” Sheila Heen, author of Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well, similarly talks about the importance of being specific. Do you have any feedback for me? “That’s a terrible question,” Heen says. Instead ask, What is one thing I could improve? What’s one thing I could have done better?
  
  
  We can put Grant and Sheen’s advice together and draft a feedback form for the three people we choose. It doesn’t have to be a grand announcement that you’ve appointed so-and-so to your challenge network. Put a couple of specific questions together then tell them, I’m trying to get better at [my job, being a parent, public speaking, etc.], so I’m looking for some honest feedback. Could you take a few minutes to answer these questions?
  
  
  We want to stay perpetually in what Grant calls “improving mode.” Like the Olympic athlete always striving to get a little bit better, Grant says, “Improving mode means you’re always a work in progress.”
  
  
  That’s what the Stoics considered themselves: a work in progress. There were no sages, they said, there were no perfect Stoics. There were just students—lifelong students. They didn’t see philosophy as an end to which one aspires, but as something one applies. Not occasionally but, as we talked about yesterday, over the course of a lifetime, making incremental progress along the way.
  
  
  Let’s make that commitment today to a lifetime of progress. We cannot be dismissive or defensive or closed off. We have to be open. We have to welcome feedback. We have to be in improving mode, always. That’s what Epictetus said. “Finally decide,” he told one of his students, “that you are an adult who is going to devote the rest of your life to making progress.” And you can being that journey today, by asking three people you trust to help you figure out where to start.

  Day 6: Join A Club Or Community
  “A branch cut away from the branch beside it is simultaneously cut away from the whole tree. So too a human being separated from another is cut loose from the whole community. The branch is cut off by someone else. But people cut themselves off—through hatred, through rejection—and don’t realize that they’re cutting themselves off from the whole civic enterprise. Except that we also have a gift, given us by Zeus, who founded this community of ours. We can reattach ourselves and become once more components of the whole.” — Marcus Aurelius
  
  You hear people talk about how crazy this world is. How we’ve never been more connected, with all of our “friends” on all of our “social” networks, while at the same time we’ve never felt so lonely. We have a record number of people struggling with social anxiety, with depression, with loneliness. It doesn’t make any sense, people will say.
  
  
  The founders of the school of Stoicism would say otherwise. As would the founders of the American experiment, the founders of a well-run business, GMs of a well-run sports organization, parents of a well-run family. To them this would all make perfect sense. A healthy country, a good school, a sustainable business, a happy home—each of these is built on the same things: community, culture, tradition.
  
  
  Any good leader who was paying attention would say of course our world is plagued by human disconnection. We’ve torn down community—the office, the town square, the local public parks and pools—and replaced it with exactly nothing. We’ve torn down culture and tradition—patriotism, marriage, the canon of great minds—and we haven’t bothered to replace them either.
  
  
  The Stoic words are oikeiôsis—“affinity,” “affiliation,” “endearment” (depending on the translation and the context)—and sympatheia—the idea, as Marcus explained, that “all things are mutually woven together and therefore have an affinity for each other. Zeno and his early followers said they were the foundation of life. They believed that humans have a natural affinity for one another, that we’re social beings, bees within the same hive. Humans are at their best, they said, when interacting and working together and pushing and challenging one another.
  
  
  Your challenge today is to find a hive, to lean into your natural human inclination toward togetherness, and join a club or a community.
  
  
  The fact is that our nature not only craves but requires social interaction. The deprivation of real, rooted, meaningful bonds with our fellow human works on us mentally and spiritually in the way cigarettes or alcohol work on us physically. Look at some of the stats:
  
  In social scientist Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Putnam shows through vast amounts of data how we have become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbors, and our democratic structures. Putnam warns that our stock of social capital—our connections with each other—has plummeted, impoverishing our lives and communities. Attendance at club meetings is down 58%. Family dinners: 43% drop. Having friends over: 35% drop. All this despite the fact that joining and participating in a group cuts in half your odds of dying next year.
  
  And look at how powerful an influence those you are connected with can have:
  
  If a friend of yours becomes obese, you are 45 percent more likely to gain weight over the next two to four years. If your friend smokes, you are 61 percent more likely to be a smoker yourself. Basically: the studies show that we become like the people we spend the most time with.
  
  The Stoics understood the power of community. The entire philosophy was built on it. Zeno of Citium founded the first school of Stoicism at the Stoa Poikile  (“Painted Porch”). The stoa (“porch’”) became a place for individuals to gather, exchange ideas, and work on becoming the best version of themselves. It was the physical ground upon which the foundation of their community was laid.
  
  
  About a century after Zeno, Panaetius helped form what became known as The Scipionic Circle—a kind of philosophical club that met at the house of Scipio, one of Rome’s greatest generals. The Scipionic Circle became a breeding ground for a generation of leaders. Publius Rutilius Rufus, the Stoic politician who defied Rome’s culture of corruption, was a frequent attendee. The historian Polybius was too. The Roman historian Velleius Paterculus talked about the direct influence this club had on Scipio’s rise to greatness. He “kept constantly with him,” Paterculus writes, “two men of eminent genius, Polybius and Panaetius.”
  
  
  Plutarch talked about the direct influence this small community has, not on the members themselves, but on the world at large. “It is a fine thing,” Plutarch wrote in Moralia, “when we gain advantage from the friendship of great men, to turn it to the welfare of our community, as Polybius and Panaetius, through Scipio’s goodwill towards them, conferred great benefits upon their native States.”
  
  
  Some two hundred years later, after surviving slavery in the Roman Empire, Epictetus followed Zeno’s footsteps back to Greece where he founded a school. From all over the empire, people made the more than five hundred mile trek to gather in Epictetus’ classroom. The impoverished, the disadvantaged, the affluent, future senators and even the future emperor Hadrian, we’re told, all came together to learn about, discuss, and debate the Stoic philosophy they all pursued. Epictetus spoke powerfully about those ideas of oikeiôsis and sympatheia, as well as the inhumanness of life without it:
  
  
  “Just as it would not be a foot, don’t you realize that in isolation you would not be a human being? Because what is a human being? Part of a community – the community of gods and men, primarily, and secondarily that of the city we happen to inhabit, which is only a microcosm of the universe in toto.”
  
  
  Social clubs. Community gatherings. Chapter meetings to debate questions, exchange knowledge, push each other to improve, and spur positive societal changes. Until relatively recently, life revolved around this kind of community-mindedness. You can see the vestiges of these once-powerful groups, in America at least, still hanging on today, though just barely: Rotary Club, Kiwanis, Elks Lodge, Junior League, American Legion, Lions Club. With the exception of Junior League, if you know someone in one of these groups, chances are they are much older than you, and it is a very real possibility that their chapter could die with them and their fellow community members. Which would be an absolute shame–for the cause of community, for humanity, and for you.
  
  
  In 1727, Ben Franklin started and twelve others started a “club for mutual improvement” called The Junto. In 1833, William Lloyd Garrison started The American Anti-Slavery Society and in 1841, a 23-year-old Frederick Douglass who had just escaped slavery began attending chapter meetings on his way to leading the abolitionist movement. In 1896, Mary Desha and three other women founded The Daughters Of The American Revolution. The long list of women who became members and what they went on to accomplish is astounding. More recently, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are in a bridge club together.
  
  
  “Associate with people who are likely to improve you,” Seneca said. “Welcome those who you are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach.” When you’re consider what club or community to join (or maybe even start), let Seneca’s rule be your guide because what he’s describing is what community is all about. A process of mutual improvement, benefit, and enjoyment.
  
  
  Though, as we mentioned, community-mindedness is on the decline, there are still some good options out there. Here are some tools for finding them:
  
  Volunteer Match connects people with organizations with local events that match your interests.
  Meetup allows you to search and explore clubs, meetings, events in your area. As their purpose statement says, it’s “a platform for finding and building local communities.”
  Active.com is a great platform for finding and learning about activities happening near you. You can discover and sign up for clubs, team sports, races and interact with those who share your interests.
  
  And here are some specific options we think might be worth your time:
  
  Book clubs like the Quarantine Book Club, the Silent Book Club, the retired NFL quarterback Andrew Luck’s Book Club.
  Rotary is a storied international service-oriented organization that is renowned for the networking it facilitates among its membership, who are primarily entrepreneurs and business leaders.
  Daily Stoic Life is our digital stoa—one bigger and more inclusive than Zeno could have ever imagined. It’s the largest community of Stoics since the ancient world. When you join our community, you also get access for free to all our Daily Stoic courses and challenges, plus all sorts of other great stuff, including our 2018 and 2019 collected books of meditations plus one of our Stoic medallions absolutely free.
  
  Whatever club or community it is that you decide to join, you should feel excited not only about the immediate personal benefits you will experience, but also about the service you are doing in helping rebuild what makes us uniquely human. The line from yesterday applies again: only beasts can survive alone.

  Day 7: Review Your Worst Day Of 2020
  “Many grim events do befall us, terrible and hard to endure. Because I could not remove you from their path, I armed your minds to combat them all: endure with courage. This is where you may surpass God: he is beyond the endurance of evil, you triumph over it.” — Seneca, On Providence
  
  There is a reason the readership of Seneca’s letters and essays has eclipsed all the other Stoics’ combined. No one has written more powerfully and relatably about the struggles of being a human being in the world. And there’s a reason he was able to do so. He could speak from experience. His life was a series of struggles and setbacks. No one knew better how life can take our plans and blow them up, how fortune has a habit of behaving just as she pleases.
  
  
  In 20 AD, just a few years into his promising career, a chronic lung condition forced him to spend over a decade isolated in Egypt to recover. In 31 AD, on the journey back to Rome, his uncle was killed in a shipwreck. In 37 AD, Seneca was nearly executed by the emperor Caligula because, Dio Cassius tells us, “he pleaded a case well in the Senate while the emperor was present.” When a female associate told Caligula about Seneca’s lung issues, he spared Seneca, preferring the thought that Seneca lived in suffering. Then, in a span of less than two years, Seneca’s father died, his firstborn son died, and twenty days after burying his son, he was banished from Rome by Caligula’s successor Claudius. It would be another eight years in isolation away from Rome.
  
  
  One of the first things Seneca did after fate delivered another round of personal blows was write Consolation To Helvia—a long letter consoling his mother. He assured her, “I am not suffering any ill.” He likened himself to the seasoned “trained soldier.” He talked about the comfort of knowing he’d been through worse things and overcome them. This is the “blessing conferred by misfortune,” he told her, “that it brings strength to those it plagues.”
  
  
  2020 was a kind of year that much of Seneca’s writing was concerned with. Simply put, it was a brutal year. We all had some terrible days. Our plans were dashed to pieces. We witnessed Fortune behave just as she pleases—fires, locust swarms, hurricanes, floods, and a pandemic to boot. Our hometowns were overtaken by protests and riots. Our careers were detoured or destroyed. We couldn’t see loved ones. We lost loved ones. Just when we thought, well at least it can’t get any worse, it somehow got worse.
  
  
  Our instinct is to say let’s just put that all behind us. It’s a new year, let’s put 2020 completely in the rear view. Seneca’s advice to Helvia, and now to us, is to do the opposite.
  
  
  Don’t conceal the wounds, he said, tear them open. Don’t push your misfortunes away, “set them all down before you in a pile.” That’s what we’re going to do today. We’re going to review our worst day from 2020. That day where you felt totally and completely defeated. The day where you were certain it couldn’t get worse and Fortune said ‘hold my beer.’ Grab that day and set it down before you.
  
  
  “What form of consolation is this, to call back suffering that has been consigned to oblivion and to set the mind, when it can scarcely endure one tribulation, in full view of all its tribulations?”
  
  
  Seneca thought you might ask. Consider, he said, when a person’s condition reaches peak severity, the cure is often found in opposite methods. The angry man needs gratitude. The hateful man needs love. The grieving need acceptance.
  
  
  Instead of confining our worst day to a box that we lock up and put in our mental attic never to be opened again, we put its contents on full display and use them. We call it all back—the day, what happened, how we felt in those moments. How it felt like we couldn’t possibly get through it. We just couldn’t fathom a way forward. We couldn’t possibly bounce back from that kind of blow to our bank account or our career or our personal life. Yes, call all those feelings back.
  
  
  Then what? Seneca knew that question was coming too. Recognize a very simple, obvious reality: you are still here. You survived. This should make you sit up a little straighter, stand up a little taller. Because it should force you to realize that you are unshakeable if you choose to be. Fortune’s harshest, most disastrous blows are no match for you. You have shown that “there is nothing in my state to justify my being described as wretched.”
  
  
  You don’t just think you can overcome misfortune, you have proof that you can. That proof is the foundation of strength and confidence. The battle-tested soldier knows what the rookie doesn’t: we will prevail. We will come out the other side of this. And when we do, we’ll be even stronger.
  
  
  The word in the ancient world was virtus. It was the most revered quality a human being could have—a strong spirit. It wasn’t something innate. It was something one had to acquire through the demonstration of will. Which is why the Stoics relished adversity so much. It was the arena in which one had the chance to earn that exalted spirit. “We ask for hardship and danger,” as the ancient historian Livy wrote, “let us prove our spirit and exercise our courage.”
  
  
  Marcus Aurelis said it too. Instead of telling ourselves that we’re unlucky because our expectations were disappointed, we should do the opposite:
  
  
  “No it’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it — not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it.”
  
  
  No one would have chosen this year we’ve all just stepped out of. To have our lives so disrupted. To be out of work. To lose money or people we love. To see people scared or stressed or struggling.
  
  
  But, the Stoics would ask: how does that make us unfortunate? We haven’t been deprived of our ability to respond. Our character remains intact. There’s no rule that says you have to freak out about this or be shattered by it or that you have to start getting anxious about the future.
  
  
  No, you’re alive. Which means you’re still in control. You’re still you. That’s very fortunate. And there’s no greater test or example of that fortune than the fact that you are still here and able to reflect on your worst day of the past year.
  
  
  That’s why Seneca called misfortune a blessing. Without it, of course we’ll be weak. Our tears and groans and pity should go to those whose life has been one long stretch of uninterrupted ease and happiness, Seneca said. The slightest injury will soon be their destruction.
  
  
  As for you, when things go wrong, when Fortune inevitably deals you a bad hand, you’re not cowed by it. You’re like Roosevelt after someone shot him point blank. “It takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose,” he said.
  
  
  Take your worst day from 2020. Set it down before you. Spend time with it. Realize the blessing it was, the strength it’s given you. Then say to it, it’s going to take more than that to stop me.

  Day 8: Take A 1 Hour Walk. Recall What You See
  “We should take wandering outdoor walks, so that the mind might be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.” — Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 17.8
  
  At the age of 40, following the massive failures of several military campaigns, Winston Churchill was demoted and then he resigned from government. Stripped of power and consumed with anxiety, he took up an unexpected new hobby: painting. His process was simple: go out in nature, take it all in, go back and paint from memory. 
  
  
  “Painting came to my rescue in a most trying time,” Churchill would later write in essays that would become a small book, Painting as a Pastime. It wasn’t so much the act of painting, he said, but how the act of painting changed the way he saw and went through the world. The extraordinary number of components that make up a single landscape. The objects he never noticed before. The world and all its beauty, “all its treasures.” This was the priceless benefit of his new hobby:
  
  “I found myself instinctively as I walked noting the tint and character of a leaf, the dreamy, purple shades of mountains, the exquisite lacer of winter branches, the dim, pale silhouettes of far horizons. And I had lived for forty years without ever noticing them… I think this heightened sense of observation of Nature is one of the chief delights that have come to me through trying to paint.”
  
  The term is exstasis—a heavenly experience that takes us outside ourselves, that connects us with something greater. This is one way the Stoics sought to cultivate wisdom—by finding beauty in everyday life. To notice the way a leaf has character. The trackless woods. The clouds cutting over the wing of an airplane. The paw prints in the morning dewy grass. The asphalt’s smell after a light afternoon rainfall. The woven textured pattern of the acorn’s cap. The steam wafting from the road drain. The drooping branches that changed course to accommodate for lamp posts and cable lines. The birds hanging out in a tree, the squirrels chasing each other up trunks, the pine cones falling to earth. 
  
  
  It’s so easy to not see any of it. The beauty, these treasures, are always available to us, yet like Churchill, we can go decades without noticing them. 
  
  
  Your challenge today is to go for an hour walk and notice the beauty that surrounds you. 
  
  
  Today, we’re going to notice it all. We’re going to experience that chief delight that changed Churchill’s life, that rescued him at a most trying time. We’re going to absorb the present moment. No phone. headphones. No nothing. Just you, your eyes, and your surroundings. 
  
  
  Then, when you get home, you’re going to capture from memory what you just saw. You can paint like Churchill. You can draw. You can write in a google doc or a journal. It’s up to you. The important thing is to keep in mind as you walk that you’re going to have to describe what you saw. That will require you to be fully present. 
  
  
  It’s striking, the number of people who have achieved extraordinary financial success, who had all the power in the world and on-demand access to anything and everything, who have also agreed that the sources of true happiness are things that are available to all of us.
  
  
  In that letter to his mother we talked about yesterday, Seneca talks about this at length. It was part of the reason, he said, that exile couldn’t make him miserable like it does most. Yes, his wealth and his career and his reputation were all taken from him. But, he said, he’d kept those things where they could be taken without disturbing him. When he had the money and the position and the influence, he put space between them and his happiness. We were born with everything we need to be happy, he said. “Nature’s intention was that we should need no great equipment for living in happiness: every one of us is capable of making himself happy.” He told his mother about Corsica, the island he’d been exiled to. He told her about how it’s barrenness allowed the planets to light up the night sky more than it can in a busy city like Rome. The sun glides on, he said, the surrounding water acts as a kind of natural security. Exile only further proved to him that “everyone of us is capable of making himself happy.”
  
  
  Marcus Aurelius, who is supposedly this dark and dour Stoic, also talked about the restorative power of nature.  He wrote some stunningly beautiful lines in his Meditations about the natural treasures all around us:
  
  The way loaves of bread split open on top in the oven; 
  The ridges are just by-products of the baking, and yet pleasing, somehow: they rouse our appetite without our knowing why; 
  The furrowed brow of the lion;
  Flecks of foam on the boar’s mouth;
  How ripe figs begin to burst;
  Or olives on the point of falling: the shadow of decay gives them a peculiar beauty;
  Stalks of wheat bending under their own weight; 
  The jaws of live animals as beautiful as painted ones or sculptures; 
  The distinct beauty of old age in men, women, and at the loveliness of children;
  
  Marcus must have had a practice similar to Churchill’s. It’s unlikely he was sitting with those objects when he wrote about them. “We should remember,” he wrote, “that even Nature’s inadvertence has its own charm, its own attractiveness.” 
  
  
  Do you see why the Stoics said this was a high form of wisdom? There’s great power in seeing what others are blind to, in being swept off your feet by what others walk right past, in discovering the treasures Nature placed all around us.
  
  
  It’s artistry. 
  
  
  For centuries, the great artists and thinkers have gotten outdoors because they had to, because it freed them from the prison of their own minds and the putridity of the cities in which they lived. Nature cleared their minds and helped them produce better work. Senece wrote about the outdoors as a kind of medicine. “We should take wandering outdoor walks,” Seneca said, “so that the mind might be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.” 
  
  
  In more recent times, that advice has been backed up by research study after research study:
  
  Like any physical activity, walking helps release endorphins that can minimize stress hormones and combat mild depression. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers found that physical activities like walking reorganize the brain so that it can better cope with stress and anxiety.
  In a meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal, which involved almost 460,000 participants, walking was found to lower risks of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in men and women. 
  According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, walking helps boost the immune system. In the study of more than 1,000 participants, men and women who walk at least twenty minutes a day, five days a week, experienced 43% fewer sick days. And even when sick, the severity for walker’s was lower. 
  
  So take a walk. It’s an affordable luxury and antidote available to us all. Take an unfamiliar route. Immerse yourself in the newness of your surroundings. Listen to the leaves crunch underfoot. Feel the ground push back against you. Get lost. Be unreachable. Go Slowly. And take it all in.

  Day 9: Pick A Hard Thing To Tackle This Year. Take Your First Step Today.
  “What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid the world of? What would he have done in the absence of such challenges? Obviously he would have just rolled over in bed and gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.” — Epictetus
  
  Katie Wells—creator of Wellness Mama, founder of the natural personal care products company Wellnesse, and longtime practicing Stoic—told us that her family’s motto is that “we were made to do hard things.”
  
  
  They’re right.
  
  
  Though the Stoics would put it slightly different: We are made by doing hard things. We find out who we really are when we challenge ourselves, when we struggle with adversity, when we step outside our comfort zone.
  
  
  Think back. The turning points in your life, the pivotal moments, the experiences that made you you—most, if not all, of them involve overcoming something difficult.
  
  
  Finishing college.
  
  
  Training for a marathon.
  
  
  Mustering the courage to tell him or her how you really feel.
  
  
  Leaving the well-paying job to pursue your dream.
  
  
  Picking up two part time jobs in the early stages of your startup.
  
  
  Trying to make it as an artist.
  
  
  5 am conditioning sessions then practice then school.
  
  
  Moving to a foreign country by yourself.
  
  
  Taking on more projects than you thought you could handle.
  
  
  Our identities are built on these moments; on how we struggle with difficulty and persevere through adversity; on how we take the leap, fall flat on our faces, get back up, try again, and (hopefully) succeed. That’s why Seneca said he pitied the person who doesn’t experience hardship:
  
  
  “You are unfortunate in my judgement, for you have never been unfortunate. You have passed through life with no antagonist to face you; no one will know what you were capable of, not even you yourself.’ For a man needs to be put to the test if he is to gain self-knowledge; only by trying does he learn what his capacities are.”
  
  
  The Stoics knew that a life without difficulty is a kind of death. That there’s no growth without resistance. And that as soon as we stop growing, we start dying.
  
  
  Core to the philosophy is a commitment to a life of improvement, of progress, of being a little bit better today than you were yesterday. The sage, the master, the perfectly formed human being—these, the Stoics believed, were not destinations but directions. Ones we pursue for as long as we walk this earth. We don’t wait around for that improvement, for someone to guide us down that path of progress. No, we pursue it. We do hard things.
  
  
  Your challenge today is just that: pick a hard thing to pursue this year.
  
  
  It could be a marathon. It could be an Ironman, a Spartan Race, a personal PR of push-ups or pull-ups. It could be starting that blog or that YouTube channel you’ve been thinking about starting. It could be giving up cigarettes or social media or television or alcohol or fast food or candy. It could be committing to habituate something you’ve had difficulty sticking with in the past—journaling every morning, reading an hour a day, getting up earlier.
  
  
  There’s got to be something you’ve thought about doing. Something you’ve wanted to do, something you know would make your life better, but you have continuously talked yourself out of doing. Or maybe it’s something you tried before and failed at.
  
  
  Pick that. Then take the first step toward doing it. Sign up for the marathon or the spartan race. Buy a domain name or create a YouTube account. Delete Twitter or Facebook or Instagram from your phone. Sell the TV. Throw out the pack of cigarettes. Pour the alcohol down the drain. Get a moleskin journal.
  
  
  Take the first step. You should feel both some reluctance and excitement. You’re stepping into difficulty, discomfort, the unknown—of course you’ll have some reservations. That’s a good sign. It means it’s something worth doing, something you have to do.
  
  
  That was Eleanor Roosevelt’s lifelong rule: to do the thing she felt she could not do. Her life is an incredible illustration of what can happen when you follow that rule. In childhood, she persisted onward despite losing both her parents and her brother. She conquered her shyness and became a leading public figure. She overcame sexism and preconceptions about the role of a First Lady—a job she never wanted—to turn it into a powerful pulpit for good. She forgave her husband’s betrayals and affairs, even though they absolutely crushed her. Each time she faced difficulties or limitations—internally or externally—she transcended them. She pushed past her fears, her reservations, her doubts, the internal and external voices telling her, you can’t, it’s too hard, it’s not possible. This is what made her great. Look at any great figure, anyone you admire, and you will see the same thing. The greats do hard things, the things they think they cannot do.
  
  
  In the Stoics’ writings, we see them constantly reminding themselves and others—and now us—that we are capable of far more than we know. We can do far more than anyone else thinks. Were they here today, they might consider that one of the silver linings of 2020.
  
  
  We mentioned it on Day 1—2020 was filled with Stockdale moments. That is, it was filled with a ton of hard things: political corruption, cultural division, pandemic shutdown, virtual learning struggles, job losses. It was a difficult year. But, as Cicero said, “The greater the difficulty, the greater the splendor.” Or, if you prefer, Seneca: “The greater the torment the greater the glory.”
  
  
  The greater the difficulty, the greater the opportunity…to reveal the great strength and power within us.
  
  
  We have to seek and seize those opportunities. We have to ignore that “can’t/don’t/won’t/shouldn’t” voice in our heads.
  
  
  Whether you’re looking at the life of Marcus Aurelius or James Stockdale or Eleanor Roosevelt, what you’re seeing is men and women who did things that no one thought they could do. Things that, at the outset, even they probably didn’t think they could do.
  
  
  And we are heirs to that tradition. We have the ability to live by Katie Wells’ motto and Eleanor Roosevelt’s dictum.
  
  
  Do hard things. Do the thing you cannot do, but have always wanted to try. Starting today.

  Day 10: Put Up A Statue Of Someone You Want To Be Like
  “Why should I not keep statues of great men to kindle my enthusiasm, and celebrate their birthdays? Why should I not continually greet them with respect and honour? The reverence which I owe to my own teachers I owe in like measure to those teachers of the human race, the source from which the beginnings of such great blessings have flowed.” — Seneca, Letters, 64. 8-9
  
  
  Marcus Aurelius had two equally formative role models in his life—his adopted grandfather Hadrian and his adopted father Atoninus. From one, Marcus learned what kind of person he didn’t want to be. From the other, he learned the kind of person he aspired to be.
  
  
  By all accounts, Hadrian, despite some good qualities, was the kind of person we see Marcus working to avoid becoming in the pages of his Meditations. One biographer called it a “lions complex.” Hadrian had a terrible temper. He was erratic, envious, lustful, selfish. He was a globetrotter, frequently skipping out on his responsibilities. Cassius Dio tells the story of one of his journeys when a woman approached him and asked for his help. “I don’t have time,” Hadrian told her. “Then stop being emperor,” the woman replied. Hadrian was careless with the state’s budget. He was a lavish spender without much concern for the common good.
  
  
  Antoninus was in many ways Hadrian’s opposite. Marcus opens Meditations cataloging what he learned from seventeen figures in his life. Hadrian is conspicuously absent from the list. Though his nearly three-page rundown of Antoninus clearly carries some implicit criticisms of Hadrian.
  
  
  “Compassion,” Marcus starts his list of lessons from Antoninus. “Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work…Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good. His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved…His altruism…His constancy to friends…His advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things. His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to flatter him.His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility—and blame—for both….This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts.”
  
  
  The Stoics tell us to learn from both the good and the bad. They said we should have great role models and flawed ones. We should identify what we admire in people and work to bring more of that out of ourselves. Whe should also figure out what we detest in people and work to make sure we don’t become that. It’s not enough, they said, to aspire to be like an Antoninua. We must also work not to be like the Hadrians of the world. That’s how Marcus became Marcus—the first philosopher king, the last good emperor.
  
  
  That’s what today’s challenge asks of you: to identify someone you want to be like then put up a reminder of that person.
  
  
  It could be a statue. It could be a bust on your desk. But it could also be their biography on your nightstand. It could be your favorite quote from something they wrote or said, written on an index card, and taped to the space beside your laptop’s trackpad. It could be a photo on your phone or desktop home screen. It could be, like Marcus’, a written list of everything you admire about them that you stick on your fridge or in your wallet. You could go on Etsy and get a custom “WW[insert first initial]D?” bracelet. Anything that you will see every day and that, when you see it, reminds you of the kind of person you aspire to become.
  
  
  It’s impossible to miss when you study the lives of the Stoics. Like Marcus, they all had role models who they were explicitly trying to be like. The reason? Unlike so many of the other philosophical schools, the Stoics were doers. They were civic-minded. They had tremendous responsibilities. Marcus Aurelius led the empire. Seneca was a writer and a political advisor. Cato was a soldier and a senator. Thrasea was a senator and a leader of the Stoic Opposition. Epictetus was a teacher, lecturing to audiences filled with some of Rome’s most powerful figures.
  
  
  These were busy people with all sorts of outside influences vying to pull them off course. So it was key, in order to be good and do good, that they have a kind of North Star. Someone in their lives that kept them centered. A reminder of the kind of person the wanted to be. A role model to keep them on course.
  
  
  As Seneca wrote to a friend who’d asked for advice:
  
  
  Happy is he who can so revere a man as to calm and regulate himself by calling him to mind! One who can so revere another, will soon be himself worthy of reverence. Choose therefore a Cato…Choose a master whose life, conversation, and soul-expressing face have satisfied you; picture him always to yourself as your protector or your pattern. For we must indeed have someone according to whom we may regulate our characters; you can never straighten that which is crooked unless you use a ruler.
  
  
  And in another letter, he explains, “Our predecessors have worked much improvement… Why should I not keep statues of great men to kindle my enthusiasm? Why should I not continually greet them with respect and honour?”
  
  
  Marcus chose Antoninus. Seneca chose Cato. Thrasea chose Cato as well. Cato, for his part, chose his grandfather Cato The Elder. Epictetus chose Musonius Rufus. But the Stoics are far from unique in holding up heroes.
  
  
  In 1799, when Napoleon became First Consul of France, the first thing he did when he moved into the royal palace was set up a hall of statues of figures like Demosthenes, Cato, and George Washington.
  
  
  In the entrance of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson had busts of Voltaire and Turgot, as well as paintings of Saint Jerome, Americus Vespucius, John Adams, and Jesus.
  
  
  But again, it doesn’t have to be a literal carved or cast figure. As we talked about on Day 3, Media Titan Arianna Huffington keeps a Marcus Aurelius quote laminated in her wallet, on her desk, and on her night stand.
  
  
  We talked to the sculptor, E.S. Schubert, about it not too long ago. Given that E.S has spent his life shaping people’s likeness into clay and carving them from marble, he seemed like the right person to ask: Why do statues matter? Why are reminders important? “We all need Lodestars,” he said. “We all need constant, daily, hourly, and minute by minute reminders of how we want to act in the world.”
  
  
  And we need encouragement, Marcus said. When we think about the qualities of the people we aspire to be like, when we look at their bust on our desk or their portrait on our wall he said, “nothing is as encouraging.” It’s good to keep them in mind.
  
  
  Who is your Lodestar? Your North Star? Who is the ruler you measure yourself against? Who draws you back on course when the events of life or the drift of inertia subtly misdirect you? This is what you are trying to figure out today. Then, the question becomes: are you living by the example they set and the values they stand for?

### [ Day 11: Inflict A Hardship on Yourself ](https://dailystoic.com/day-11-nyny2021/)

  Day 11: Inflict A Hardship on Yourself
  “Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I feared?” It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence.” — Seneca, Letters, 18.5-6
  
  The Stoics tell us that Fortune is a fickle mistress. Just when things seem to be going well, she abandons us. Just when things seem like they can’t get any worse, she piles on…and then, sometimes, we’re caught completely by surprise when a seemingly impossible situation turns around. Ideally, we want to remove these unexpected swings from our lives as much as possible.
  
  
  How do we do that?
  
  
  From the late Roman collection of biographies known as the Historia Augusta, we get this story of Marcus Aurelius: “He studied philosophy with ardour, even as a youth. For when he was twelve years old he adopted the dress and, a little later, the hardiness of a philosopher, pursuing his studies clad in a rough Greek cloak and sleeping on the ground; at his mother’s solicitation, however, he reluctantly consented to sleep on a couch strewn with skins.”
  
  
  Cato famously walked around Rome in his worst clothes. Seneca started the year with a cold plunge, he reserved days for fasting, and weeks for practicing poverty.
  
  
  These practices—sleeping on the floor, dressing in rough and ragged clothes, cold exposure, eating like a pauper—were part of what the Stoics called voluntary hardships. And they made a distinction between what we challenged you to do on Day 9—tackle a hard thing—and what we’re challenging you to do today—inflict a hardship. The former is about the doing, and the latter is about the going without. It’s the difference between Sisyphus pushing the boulder up a hill versus taking away his shoes. Or Marcus waking up earlier than he preferred versus sleeping without a mattress.
  
  
  The purpose of doing hard things is growth—being able to do more. The purpose of inflicting hardships is resilience—being able to withstand more.
  
  
  It’s a subtle but important distinction. We can all think of people who do hard things all the time but crumbled under the hardships that 2020 delivered. Which is why the Stoics were spot-on in saying that those in pursuit of the good life need to routinely do both: tackle hard things and inflict hardships upon themselves.
  
  
  Today’s challenge is to shift our attention to imposing hardships upon ourselves and work on building up what the philosopher Pierre Hadot, writing about Marcus’s life, called our “inner citadel.”
  
  
  Marcus talked about how hardship either affects the body or the soul. But only one of those do we have any say over. “The soul can choose not to be affected,” he wrote, “preserving its own tranquility. All our decisions, urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them.” Through voluntary hardship, Marcus was building a soul, a core, an inner fortress that fate, chaos, hysterics, vice, and outside influence could never penetrate or break down.
  
  
  Like Marcus we are going to strengthen the walls of our inner citadel through hardship. Sure, we could wait around for Fortune to suddenly shift things, for external circumstances to force our hand, and then let Fate have its say. Or, we can beat her to the punch and inflict hardship on ourselves. We can practice. We can build up and reinforce our inner citadel. We can prepare for the next Fortune who, to paraphrase Seneca, behaves just as she pleases.
  
  
  The Stoic chooses the latter. Because “neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once,” Epictetus said, “he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself.”
  
  
  Your options for this kind of preparation are many. Like Marcus, you can sleep on the ground tonight. Like Cato, you can wear your worst clothes today. Like Seneca, you can fast or eat only rice and beans today. Instead of driving or calling an Uber, you can walk. Instead of taking a hot shower, take a cold one. Instead of blasting the heat all day, turn it off. Instead of sitting in your comfy office chair, stand. Instead of stopping for that no-foam double latte, drink a cup of instant…or nothing at all.
  
  
  Throughout the day, just think: if I weren’t this fortunate, what might this look like? If I couldn’t afford this luxury, what would I have to do?
  
  
  Most people look to make life easier and smoother. That’s our instinct—to avoid any kind of discomfort. And the world has never been set up so well to help us do that. We can almost always click a few buttons on that device in our pockets and have the myriad frictions of human existence smoothed away. Any slight feeling of hunger or boredom? Is it a little too cold? A little too hot? Is that chore a little too hard? No problem, there’s an app for that. Because we don’t have to put up with these minor inconveniences anymore, most of us…we don’t.
  
  
  The problem with that approach is that sometimes a 2020 happens. Hardships are global, more severe, longer lasting. They catch virtually everyone completely off guard. The people who always ate out, who had the cleaning lady come every other day, who had no experience making $25K a year, who always took that summer trip to the Carribean, who outsourced homework help—they all panicked. They stormed and emptied stores of toilet paper and hand sanitizer. They bought up surgical masks and respirators until there were none available for healthcare workers. They spread rumors, misinformation, and theories faster than the virus, because it was easier to reckon with than the uncomfortable truth that they were totally helpless. Those reactions are what come out of a world conditioned with comfort.
  
  
  Contrast that response to what Marcus did when the Antonine Plague hit Rome. As Dio Cassius tells us, “Marcus “took all the imperial ornaments to the Forum and sold them for gold. When the barbarian uprising had been put down, he returned the purchase price to those who voluntarily brought back the imperial possessions, but used no compulsion in the case of those who were unwilling to do so.” Another biographer adds that Marcus sold “not just sumptuous furniture from the imperial apartments, gold goblets, silver flagons, crystals and chandeliers, but also his wife’s silken, gold-embroidered robes and her jewels.”
  
  
  This was a man who had unfettered control of Rome’s budget. He could have levied higher taxes, he could have looted the provinces, he could have kicked the can down the road, running up bills his successors would have to deal with. He could have taken the easy way and avoided any personal strain or hardship.
  
  
  But he didn’t. Because he had prepared to not need to. He practiced getting by with less—wearing ragged clothes, eating the scantest fare, sleeping as if he were homeless. He had built his inner citadel to stand strong when it seemed like his royal palace might come down around him.
  
  
  That’s what Stoicism was made for. It teaches us to—as they say in the military—“embrace the suck” and find security, even peace, in the midst of crisis.
  
  
  By practicing hardship voluntarily, you are better prepared for life’s involuntary struggles. You can remain undisturbed when others easily break. You can shrug and laugh off what makes others sulk and complain. When your hotel seems to have run out of hot water, you don’t lose a second complaining like the guy shouting at the helpless front desk clerk working the graveyard shift. When your flight is delayed and you have to spend the night curled up on a three seater at your gate, you don’t even think to consider yourself inconvenienced. When a global lockdown order temporarily restricts your food options to whatever’s on hand, you’re not sure why panicked shoppers are emptying grocery shelves.
  
  
  Get out of your comfort zone today. Embrace suffering. Build your inner citadel. Undergo hardship voluntarily. Only then will you be better prepared for all that life can throw at you.

  Day 12: Pick 1 Author. Read Everything They’ve Written This Year. Start Right Now
  “This reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind.” — Seneca, Letters From A Stoic, 2.1
  
  Wisdom has always been prized by the Stoics. Zeno said that we were given two ears and one mouth for a reason: to listen more than we talk. And since we have two eyes, we are obligated to read and observe more than we talk as well.
  
  
  It is key today, as it was in the ancient world, to be able to distinguish between the vast aggregations of information that lay out there at our disposal and the actual wisdom that we need to live a good life. It’s key that we study, that we keep our minds open always. For you cannot learn that which you think you already know, Epictetus said.
  
  
  But what should we be learning? if our goal is to get not just smarter or more knowledgeable, but wiser, how should we do it? For most people, the obvious answer is books. A lot of people begin a new year with a commitment to read a certain number of books. I am going to read 50 books this year. I am going to read every book on that ‘Best Non-Fiction Books Of All Time’ list.
  
  
  The Stoics would admire this energy…but try to channel it properly.
  
  
  They would encourage you to begin this year by committing not to read widely, but to read deeply. To dive into a single wise thinker and come to know them like you had lived with them. As Seneca advised Lucilius in one of his letters:
  
  You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere…And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner…There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.
  
  Seneca compares most people’s reading habits to constantly changing medications or spitting up food instead of digesting it. In our reading diet, we want to avoid that. As Schopenhauer wrote, “Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.”
  
  
  It’s true. That’s why we’re challenging you today to pick a master thinker to spend the entire year with. To digest completely the works of one writer. To stay put with a great mind rather than hurrying from this one to that. Here are some suggestions, listed chronologically, with a few favorites to start with:
  
  
  Plato: The Republic, Symposium, Phaedo
  Plutarch: Lives, On Sparta, Essays
  
  
  Seneca: Letters, On the Shortness of Life, On Anger
  
  
  William Shakespeare: Hamlet, The Tempest, Julius Caesar
  
  
  Jane Austen: Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park
  
  
  Ralph Waldo Emerson: Representative Men, Essays, Journal
  
  
  Henry David Thoreau: Walden, Civil Disobedience, Journal
  
  
  Leo Tolstoy: A Calendar of Wisdom, War and Peace, Anna Karenina
  
  
  Friedrich Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil
  
  
  Virginia Woolf: Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves
  
  
  Toni Morrison: Paradise, Beloved, Song of Solomon
  
  
  Joyce Carol Oates: We Were the Mulvaneys, Wonderland, Them
  
  
  Robert Caro: The Power Broker, LBJ Series, Working
  
  
  Steven Pressfield: Gates of Fire, War of Art, Tides of War
  
  
  Robert Greene: 48 Laws Of Power, Mastery, 33 Strategies of War

  Cheryl Strayed: Wild, Tiny Beautiful Things, Brave Enough

  Zadie Smith: White Teeth, The Autograph Man, On Beauty
  
  
  Cal Newport: So Good They Can’t Ignore You, Deep Work, Digital Minimalism
  
  
  Ryan Holiday: The Obstacle Is The Way, Conspiracy, Lives of the Stoics
  
  
  You’ll notice in Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations—he quotes others dozens and dozens of times without explicitly stating who he is quoting. This was common in the ancient world, even for writers writing for an audience. Everyone was intimately familiar with the master thinkers Marcus was quoting. In the Notes section appended to Meditations, we learn he was quoting thinkers like Socrates and Epictetus and Homer and Plato. But until relatively recently, there didn’t need to be a note section. When someone read the unattributed line in book 7: “Against our will, our souls are cut off from the truth”—they knew that was from Epictetus. Or in book 10: “The earth knows longing from the rain”—from Euripides.
  
  
  The philosopher Mortimer Adler talks about it in How To Read A Book. The phrase “well-read” has gotten somewhat distorted in recent history. We hear that phrase and immediately think quantity. But the ancients would have thought quality. “A person who has read widely,” Mortimer says of the modern reader, “but not well deserves to be pitied rather than praised.” The early 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes jested similarly, “If I read as many books as most men do, I would be as dull-witted as they are.”
  
  
  Paradoxically, the great minds, Mortimer continues, would have read fewer books than a typical college education requires. Because they knew what most do not: reading is supposed to teach you HOW to think, not just WHAT to think. It’s not about knowing a bunch of facts or trivia. It’s about developing a mind you can use, not at dinner parties and game nights, but in the real world.
  
  
  That’s why reading the complete works of a single author is so powerful. It’s a window into their mind. It’s a passenger seat along their intellectual journey.
  
  
  And it doesn’t matter if you’re a philosopher, an entrepreneur, a teacher, a football coach—the goal of reading is the same: to cultivate wisdom, a mind that helps you be better at what you do. It isn’t about having a massive reservoir of information. Epictetus liked to say he couldn’t call someone wise “knowing only that they read and write. Even if ‘all night long’ is added.” He said he’d have to see the output of that energy, if “their efforts aim at improving the mind,” before he could judge someone to be wise.
  
  
  Epictetus is right. The fact is that many of the greats don’t have a ton of time to read.
  
  
  Nick Saban talked about it a few months ago. He was asked if he keeps up with all the writing published in the media and by football analysts. “I really don’t,” Saban said. “I’m always reading a book…even if I only read four or five pages a day in five minutes or something. But most of the stuff I read is something to try to help me be better at what I do.” Things that help him make good decisions when the game’s on the line. Things that help him evaluate young people’s character. Things that help him lead his staff. When asked what he’s read in the last few years that stand out: “Obstacle Is The Way,” he said. “I’ve read three of Ryan Holiday’s books.”
  
  
  Pick someone and go down the rabbit hole of their work. Quality not quantity. Intensity not extensity. Even if all you have time for is four or five pages a day. As Marcus would say, never be satisfied with just “getting the gist” of things you read. “Read attentively,” he said read deeply, repeatedly, and forcefully.

  Day 13: Set A Bedtime & End of Day Routine
  “We must allow our minds some relaxation: if rested, they will rise up the better and sharper to challenges. As one should not impose a strict regimen on rich fields— for, if their fertility is never granted remission, it will quickly exhaust them—so unremitting effort will shatter the mind’s vigour.” — Seneca, On The Tranquility of the Mind
  
  In earlier challenges, we pushed people to wake up earlier. There’s a lot of emphasis on this in really any discussion about good habits and self-improvement. There’s Jocko Willink posting a photo of his watch at 4:30 AM every morning. There’s The 5 AM Club. There’s Amy Landino’s Good Morning, Good Life. Even Marcus Aurelius, despite insomniatic tendencies, opens book 5 of Meditations with a passage about waking up early. And when he had a hard time getting up early, he’d remind himself, “I have to go to work, as a human being…I’m going to do what I was born to do.” And Seneca would similarly say of people who don’t wake up early: “Do you think that these men know how to live, if they do not know when to live?”
  
  
  The research on health, the research on happiness, the research on successful people—it all points to what the Stoics said: if you want to live a good life, wake up early.
  
  
  But for some reason we talk a lot less about going to bed.
  
  
  Seneca once observed that nearly everything in life is circular—there’s an opening and a close, a start and a finish. Life, he says, is a collection of large circles enclosing smaller ones. Birth to death is one circle. Within that, adulthood. Within that, childhood. Within that, a year. Within that, a month. And “the smallest circle of all,” he writes, “is the day; but even a day has its beginning and its ending, its sunrise and its sunset.”
  
  
  He then gets to his main point, which is to say that life’s greatest pleasures are found where the circle is rounded out. “Fruits are most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close…Each pleasure reserves to the end the greatest delights which it contains.” 
  
  
  “Every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence…let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness.” 
  
  
  Seneca was right. And there’s no joy or gladness when you’re in bed with a mind at war with itself looking back on the day and all the things you could or should have done. Or one racing about everything you have to do when you wake up in six or seven hours. That’s no way to round out one of life’s greatest pleasures. 
  
  
  That’s why today’s challenge is to close out the day more intentionally, to create an evening routine, so we can go to sleep with joy and gladness.
  
  
  Tim Ferriss has talked a little bit about evening routines. People always want to hear about his morning routine or that of the hundreds of top performers he’s interviewed. But “for me,” Ferriss says, “a reliable nighttime routine is just as important.” Using your nights to improve your mornings, rounding out one circle before you open the next—that’s synergy, that’s what it takes to live a good life.
  
  
  But what are the components of a good evening routine? How should we close out a day? What can we do every night to help us hit the pillow joyfully? From the Stoics we get a number of suggestions:
  
  Review — it was one of Seneca’s most famous rituals. “When the light has been removed and my wife has fallen silent,” he wrote, “I examine my entire day and go back over what I’ve done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by.” What went well today? What could I have done better? What steps did I take toward becoming the person I want to be? How close am I to becoming like that person from day 10? Every night, Seneca sat down and journaled on those kinds of questions. Progress is impossible without reflection, he’d say.
  Read — The great William Osler (founder of John Hopkins University and a fan of the Stoics) told his medical students it was important that they turn to literature as a way to nourish and relax their minds. “Start at once a bedside library and spend the last half-hour of the day in communion with the saints of humanity. There are great lessons to be learned from Job and from David, from Isaiah and St. Paul. Taught by Shakespeare you may take your intellectual and moral measure with singular precision. Learn to love Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.”
  Check In On A Relationship — Marcus wrote over and over again—we’re social beings, we can’t neglect our social duty— “because it’s characteristic of social beings that they see themselves as acting socially.” Even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to sweep across the globe and cause nationwide quarantines with no real timeline for when things will return to normal, we can’t neglect our social duty. We can make a phone call or send an email or write a letter. Seneca—one of history’s great letter writers—said it explicitly. He writes about how, though it would be preferable to physically see each other more than life permits, maintaining communication by itself still confers a valuable benefit: “I thank you for writing to me so often…I never receive a letter from you without being in your company forthwith. If the pictures of our absent friends are pleasing to us…how much more pleasant is a letter, which brings us real traces, real evidences, of an absent friend!” 
  Gratitude — It was one of Seneca’s favorite Greek proverbs: “the fool’s life is empty of gratitude.” He talks about how, by nature, we focus on the bad stuff that happens to us. At the end of an otherwise good day, we’re thinking about the one thing we dropped the ball on. Of the one hundred comments, the one rude one stays with us, not the ninety-nine positive ones. The antidote to any negative thinking is almost always gratitude. Seneca compares it to losing a loved one. The way to conquer that grief is to be grateful for the loved ones still in your life. Because it’s not where our minds naturally go, we have to schedule it. Try it. At the end of the day, maybe after you review the day, write down three or four things that happened that you are grateful for. It will alter the mental state you hit the pillow with.
  Prepare for the morning — The Stoics were big on trying to pare down what they needed to worry about. If they could eliminate a trivial decision, they did. As Marcus said, “If you seek tranquility, do less.” Most of us wake and the scramble begins. From one mundane decision to the next. What should I wear today? What should I have for breakfast? What’s on my to-do list today? Should I make coffee or stop for one? Where did I put my laptop? Are my airpods charged? What times is that meeting again? Of course we’re in bed with a racing mind. You have to break the pattern. Tonight, make tomorrow’s to-do list, put your clothes out, decide what you’re having for breakfast, prep the coffee machine, set up your desk for how you want to sit down at it, eliminate any trivial decisions, and then enjoy some of that tranquility Marcus spoke of. 
  Spend time with loved ones — Marcus clearly loved his children and his wife dearly. Even though he was important and famous and busy, he didn’t ignore them. As we mentioned above, we know that he liked to tuck his children into bed at night and indeed, the most philosophical part of his routine came as he put them to sleep. It was a practice he learned from Epictetus: “As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.” Don’t tempt fate, you say. By talking about a natural event? Is fate tempted when we speak of grain being reaped?” He drank in the moment. He was present. He cherished this thing in front of him, which really was the most important thing in his life, and then he said goodnight. 
  
  Regardless of the practices you implement or what time you decide on, the best nighttime routine is the one you can stick to. Indeed, recent research shows how a consistent sleep routine is nearly as important as how much sleep you get:
  
  Research published in the Journal Scientific Reports found a connection between irregular sleep patterns and chronic health problems. The study’s lead author, psychiatrist and behavioral scientist, Jessica Lunsford-Avery, PhD said, “The more irregular these sleep patterns, the higher the risk for obesity, hypertension, and elevated blood sugar, and the higher the projected risk of developing heart disease over the next decade.”
  In another study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers tracked the sleep patterns of 2,000 adults for five years. Participants with an irregular sleep schedule (an average gap of over 30 minutes) doubled their risk of cardiovascular disease. Conversely, participants with a regular sleep routine helps prevent heart issues similar to the way exercise and a healthy diet do. 
  
  It almost doesn’t matter what the problem is, the solution is often structure and routine. Tell a sleep expert you’re not sleeping well, that’s what they’ll suggest. Tell a psychiatrist you’ve been feeling anxious, that’s what their first question will be. Tell a productivity guru your work output isn’t where you want it, that’s where they’ll start. Tell a dog trainer your dog is acting up, that’s where they’ll start. Tell a strength trainer you want to get stronger, tell an author you want to get better at writing, tell the Stoics you want to round out the day in a calmer, more tranquil state—structure and routine is the answer. 
  
  
  It boxes out chaos and uncertainty and overwhelm and stress and even fear. Cicero wrote about how the gladiators stepped into the colosseum so poised, how they stuck their necks out without a flinch. “They are well trained. Such is the power,” he wrote, “of habit!” Bring your spouse or your kids or your roommate into the discussion. What makes sense with everyone’s schedules? Which of the above suggestions could you do together? How can you round out the circle to go to sleep with joy and gladness? “The cures for the spirit,” as Seneca said, are “with a divine ritual.”

  Day 14: Watch Or Read Something About A Topic You Know Nothing About
  “One person likes tending to his farm, another to his horse; I like to daily monitor my self-improvement.” — Epictetus, Discourses, III.5.14
  
  Seneca opens one of his letters saying he’d just gotten back from attending the lecture of a philosopher from a different school. He anticipates the question his friend Lucilius will probably have: aren’t you a little old to still be attending philosophy classes?
  
  
  Seneca says there is nothing “more foolish than refusing to learn.” Even in old age, even if you haven’t had to learn for some time now, even if you are one of the best at what you do — “you should keep learning…to the end of your life.”
  
  
  As we talked about a couple of days ago, the Stoics prized nothing more than wisdom. They said part of being a philosopher is committing to being a lifelong learner. One of the reasons, what Seneca goes on to explain to Lucilius, is that wisdom is one of the few certainties in life in the sense that it is one of the few areas of growth we have control of.
  
  
  Money is nice, Seneca admits, but making more and more of it is largely a matter of luck. Titles, influence, authority, admiration—again, these are great but for the most part, they’re out of our control. But wisdom, learning, studying, Seneca says, do not fall upon us by chance. “‘How much progress shall I make?’ you ask. Just as much as you try to make. Why do you wait? Wisdom comes haphazard to no man.”
  
  
  Seneca of course was not the only Stoic continuing to learn all the way until the end of his life. Marcus Aurelius was forty when he became emperor. Well into his reign, we learn, he was attending the lectures of a philosopher named Sextus. People sneered at him. Didn’t the emperor have more important matters to attend to? And besides, didn’t he already have the philosopher on his staff? And, didn’t most of Rome already celebrate his greatness, his great mind? Why was he going out of his way to sit in Sextus’ classroom? “Learning is a good thing,” Marcus replied to one detractor. “Even for one who is growing old. From Sextus the philosopher I shall learn what I do not yet know.”
  
  
  You have not graduated. School is not out for winter break. You are not too old or too good at what you do. No, school is life. Learning is a daily thing. Wisdom is a lifelong pursuit. You must never stop studying, learning, growing. There is nothing more foolish than giving those things up. So today’s challenge will hopefully become a lifelong habit. Every day, you should try to learn something new. Every day, you should read or watch something about a topic you know nothing about. And you should start today. Why wait?
  
  
  It should be obvious to you by this point. The next few months and years are going to be rough. We don’t know exactly how rough, but certainly, considerably rougher than last year. That’s not yours to control or prevent. What’s up to you is how ready you will be. It’s in times of peace that a nation must sharpen their swords. And it’s in times of a lockdown that you must sharpen yours.
  
  
  Regardless of what the future holds, now is the time to get ready. To use this moment, to prepare, to sharpen, to learn what you do not yet know. 
  
  
  Read about other philosophical schools. Read about psychology or physics or architecture or agriculture or nutrition or human nature or crypto or artificial intelligence or law or economics. Read about a culture you know nothing about or a part of the world you’ve never been to. Watch a Ken Burns documentary about The Civil War or The Vietnam War or national parks or jazz or baseball. Watch a TED talk on YouTube about body language or bionics or shame or quadcopters or cave symbols.
  
  
  You may be thinking that making time to learn something new, to attend classes seemingly unrelated to your profession, seems selfish when there’s people relying on you. But it isn’t selfish. It’s selfless. You know what happens when you’re learning and growing too? Everyone around you grows too. Remember what we talked about on day 6? We humans can’t help but have the character of those around us rub off on us. When you become more well-rounded, a more complete person and citizen, everyone in your vicinity does too.
  
  
  And yes, it is a little bit selfish:
  
  On a physiological level, learning new things is good for your brain. According to Behavioral and Systems Neuroscientist Tracey J. Shors, learning new skills bolsters cognitive functioning. Learning sparks a process called neurogenesis, or the creation of new brain cells, keeping the brain healthy and active, which is particularly important as we age.
  According to positive psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, in our brains, happiness and learning are tied together. Best known for coining the psychological concept of flow in his seminal work Flow: The Psychology Of Optimal Experience, Csíkszentmihályi says of learning new things: “the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times…The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”
  
  And as Robert Greene talks about in Mastery, learning and personal growth are necessary and positive endeavors. “You must convince yourself,” he writes, “people get the mind and quality of brain that they deserve through their actions. Despite the popularity of genetic explanations for our behavior, recent discoveries in neuroscience are overturning long-held beliefs that the brain is genetically hardwired. Scientists are demonstrating the degree to which the brain is actually quite plastic.” 
  
  
  When you learn new things, you create new synaptic pathways. Greene calls it the great salvation. We are heirs to the most ingenious instrument. The miracle device we use to perceive the world can grow and develop infinitely. As you learn something new today, Greene would say, “you are contributing to the most important cause of all—the survival and prosperity of the human race, in a time of stagnation.”
   
  
  
  If you’re not constantly learning and improving and adding new skills to your game, what are you doing? You’re stagnant, you’re running on the hamster wheel, you’re in what David Epstein calls the “rut of competence.” We make sure we never find ourselves in one by constantly learning and pursuing new skills. We have to build it into our day. Every day. From now to the end of your life.

  Day 15: Take 1 Thing Off Your Plate
  “Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.24
  
  There is so much on our plate. We have emails to respond to. Calls to make. There is that meeting in a couple hours. The folks we met with yesterday are waiting on an answer or a decision we promised we’d make. There are groceries to pick up. And kids to drop off. Social media beckons. So do our hopes and dreams.
  
  
  On top of all that, there’s all the new stuff that tends to add up this time of year. New goals. New resolutions. There’s the gadget so-and-so got you for Christmas that you still need to figure out how to work. There’s the new pursuit you committed to on Day 9. Yes, we’re partially responsible for adding to your plate. 
  
  
  Which is why we chose today’s challenge. We mentioned it briefly a couple days ago—Stoicism involves a reduction in what one needs to worry about. The Stoics were trying to pare down the number of extraneous things in their lives and get closer and closer to a life full of only what really mattered, what they really cared about. 
  
  
  Today, we want you to take one step in that direction by taking one thing off your plate.
  
  
  People have felt overloaded and overwhelmed since the beginning of time. Make no mistake: The ancient world was not some quiet, empty peaceful place. It too was filled with crises, distraction, and gossip. It too was filled with people who had ambitious goals and trouble prioritizing and saying “no” and making the most of their limited time on this planet. All the temptations we face today have their analogs in the past.
  
  
  Seneca said some two thousand years ago that it’s one of the hardest balances to strike in life. We definitely don’t want to be the person who can never sit still. “For love of bustle is not industry, it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind.” But we also definitely don’t want to be the person always sitting still. “True repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation, that kind of repose is slackness and inertia.” 
  
  
  The work of the philosopher, he said, is finding the perfect balance of those two tendencies—working and relaxing. Epictetus’ word was ataraxia, which appears dozens of times in his Discourses and Enchiridion. It’s a state of tranquility, free of external disturbance. It’s when you’re in control of your time, your schedule, your to-do list—not the other way around. That’s the fruit of philosophy, Epictetus said, reaping the rewards inherent in wisdom. And wisdom, he said, is perspective and priorities. 
  
  
  This is what nearly everyone misses with Tim Ferriss’ 4-Hour Workweek. It’s not about only working four hours a week. No, it’s about reducing the amount of work you don’t particularly enjoy doing to four hours a week. That’s the minimum amount Ferriss believes one can get away with. Then, you can spend the rest of your time doing the actual work you actually enjoy. Delegation, automation, and elimination lead to liberation. He also talks about it in Tools for Titans in a section about simple questions that changed the course of his life. One was, “What if I could only subtract to solve problems?” He elaborates that when advising startups, he’d direct the attention away from thinking about what they should do towards the question, “What should we simplify?” Because that question proved so successful in the startup world, Tim applied it to every aspect of his life. In his home he hung a big sign with one word, “SIMPLIFY.”
  
  
  It’s why Marcus famously shared his power, hired brilliant public servants, and empowered everyone in his court to make decisions. “If you seek tranquility,” he said, “do less.” And then he follows the note to himself with some clarification. Not nothing, less. Do only what’s essential. “Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’ 
  
  
  We talked with Matthew McConaughey about this quote a little while back. He gave a great example. At one point a few years ago, he was trying to juggle five things—he had a production company, a music label, a foundation, his acting career, and his family. He told the story of the day he called his lawyer to shut down the production company and the music label. “I was making B’s in five things,” he explained of his reasoning. “I wanna make A’s in three things.”
  
  
  That’s what each of us needs to do. We need to take the time to set our priorities straight, to ruthlessly ask of everything we do: Is this necessary? Can I eliminate this? Can I delegate that? What can I subtract from my life? What can I automate?
  
  
  We recommend you try the 80-20 analysis Ferriss does every year in replace of a New Year’s resolution. It starts with a review of the previous year. Take out your calendar. Get out a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. As you go through your calendar, week by week, on the left side of your paper, list the 20% of activities and people that produced 80% of your peak positive emotional state. What are the things you did and the people you interacted with that most moved your life forward in 2020? On the right side of your paper, list the 20% of activities and people that produced 80% of your peak negative emotional state. What were the tasks and interactions that routinely caused you to get frustrated or stressed or anxious or overwhelmed?
  
  
  Now what you have is a to-do list and a not-to-do list. Again, what people often miss—the not-to-do list doesn’t just get flung out the window. This isn’t about being careless or reckless. It’s first about eliminating through delegating or automating. The disagreeable or distracting tasks—can you use some kind of software to automate them? Can you hire a virtual assistant to delegate them to? Can you have a conversation with your boss to see if there’s someone on the team who can take over this or that?
  
  
  It doesn’t have to be work related. You could take having to decide what to wear off your plate. Barack Obama only wore gray or blue suits in office, “I’m trying to pare down decisions,” he said. “I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make…You need to focus your decision-making energy. You need to routinize yourself. You can’t be going through the day distracted by trivia.”
  
  
  You could take having to keep up with the news off your plate. “If you wish to improve,” Epictetus said, “be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.” It’s one of the most powerful things you can do as a human being in our hyperconnected, 24/7 media world: say, “I don’t know.” Or, more provocatively: “I don’t care.” Most of society seems to have taken it as a commandment that one must stay up on the news. Imagine how much more time, energy, and brain power you’d have–how much more rested and present you would be–if you cut your media consumption. 
  
  
  You could take replying to “urgent requests” off your plate. In Michael Lewis’ The Undoing Project about renowned psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, he describes how Tversky handled his mail. On his desk “there were tidy little stacks, one for each day, each filled with requests and entreaties and demands upon Amos’s time: job offers, offers of honorary degrees, requests for interviews and lectures, requests for help with some abstruse problem, bills…Each day the new mail arrived and shoved the old mail down the table. When a pile reached the end of the table Amos pushed it, unopened, off the edge into a waiting garbage can. ‘The nice thing about things that are urgent,’ he liked to say, ‘is that if you wait long enough they aren’t urgent anymore.’”
  
  
  So much of what we think we must do, so much of what we end up doing, is not essential. We do it out of habit. We do it out of guilt. We do it out of laziness. We do it because of external expectations. We do it because we just never considered we might be able to automate it with some software or outsource it or delegate it to a virtual assistant, or in the case of Amos Tversky, just ignore it. And then we wonder why we’re unhappy. Why our performance suffers. Why our heart isn’t really in it. 
  
  
  Of course we’re unhappy. When we’re doing those things on the right side of the paper, on the not-to-do list. When we’re doing things we know deep down have no real meaning. Where is there happiness and contentment to be found in that slog?
  
  
  But if we could do less inessential stuff, we’d be able to better do what is essential. We’d also get a taste of that tranquillity that Marcus was talking about. A double satisfaction. Take one thing off your plate. Pare down. SIMPLIFY. Take one step closer to a life spent doing only what really matters to you.

### [ Day 16: Take A Long Look In The Mirror: What Is Your Worst Vice? ](https://dailystoic.com/day-16-nyny2021/)

  Day 16: Take A Long Look In The Mirror: What Is Your Worst Vice?
  “We hold the flaws of others before our eyes but turn our backs toward our own…The majority of humankind gets angry not at the wrongs but at the wrongdoers. A good look at ourselves will make us more temperate if we ask ourselves: “Haven’t we ourselves also done something like that? Haven’t we gone astray in the same way? Does condemning these things really benefit us?” — Seneca, On Anger, 2.28
  
  It’s an indisputable fact of history: people have always been people. They don’t change. They remain selfish, ignorant, dishonest, and weak. It was true in Rome and it’s true all these thousands of years later. You can talk to them until you’re blue in the face, Marcus Aurelius observed, you can try to show them the errors of their ways, but it doesn’t matter. They’ll just keep on doing it.
  
  
  So what does that mean? Do we give up? No. We just change our focus.
  
  
  People might not be able to change, but we can. You might not be able to get through to your parents or your siblings or those nasty commenters on social media, but you can certainly get through to yourself. You might not be able to get your neighbors to stop littering, or lying, or laying around, but you can break those habits yourself.
  
  
  Humankind is afflicted with timeless, apparently unbreakable, vices. But you are not humankind. You are not the mob, you are not “people.” You are you. You are the one person whom you have complete control over. You can break the pattern. You can step up, you can get to work, you can make new habits.
  
  
  That, Seneca said, is what philosophy was intended for. It’s a way to look in the mirror, to scrape off one’s own faults: “Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.”
  
  
  Epictetus said half a century or so later, “If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill— of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, ‘He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.’”
  
  
  Remember, the proper direction of philosophy—of all the things we’re doing here—is focused inward. To make ourselves better and to leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey. Our faults are in our control, and so we turn to philosophy to help scrape them off like barnacles from the hull of a ship. Other people’s faults? Not so much. That’s for them to do.
  
  
  Cleanthes called it conscientiousness. He said his standards were for him. Philosophy was about the pursuit of his self-improvement. It was about being strict with himself. In fact, it wasn’t uncommon to find him walking the streets of Athens scolding himself out loud, examining the slightest faults with himself. But the fault finding started and stopped with himself.
  
  
  How foreign does that kind of temperament feel this day and age? How many of us take any chance to judge or criticize other people? How many of us are driven mad by the mistakes and the choices of other people? How many days have we let be ruined by the craziness and the rudeness of other people?
  
  
  Other people. They are our affliction. And we waste precious time talking about them and their choices. Why does she do that? Can you believe he said that? Does she actually think she looks good in that? What was he thinking!? Did you hear so-and-so might get fired? If I was in his shoes, you know what I’d do? Why don’t any of these politicians have a spine? Guess what they’re letting their kids do?
  
  
  Stoicism isn’t about judging other people. It’s not a moral philosophy you’re supposed to project and impose onto the world. It isn’t opening your eyes to the flaws of others. No, it’s a personal philosophy that’s designed to direct your behavior.
  
  
  This is what Marcus Aurelius meant when he said: “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.” And that tranquility only “comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do.” He might as well have said: Stop wasting time talking about other people, focus on yourself.
  
  
  Who cares what they should have done. Or what you would have done. Or what you think is in such bad taste. Or how you wish they could change. What matters is what you are doing. Right now. With your own life. What you can change. How you can improve. Today’s challenge is to focus on that. To turn the gaze inward. To remember that you are running your race and everyone else is running theirs. To not look out the window at all those people and all their vices, but to look in the mirror at some of your own.
  
  
  Remember from day 9—a core tenet of Stoicism is that the sage is an aspiration, not an end. Perfection of character is a direction, not a destination. What this means is there is always room for your own improvement. There is always something keeping you from the person you want to be. Our lodestar from day 10—there is always something holding us back from that ideal, some fault, some vice we have that they don’t.
  
  
  Maybe we’re lazier than we know we want to be. Maybe we lack balance—we’re so zeroed in on our career goals that our personal life has eroded. Maybe we care too much about what other people think—we haven’t pursued the life we want out of fear of what others might think or say. Maybe we’re easy to anger—we turn on the news first thing in the morning and it ruins the rest of our day. Maybe we’re selfish or arrogant or egotistical. Maybe we drink or smoke or eat more than we know is healthy. Maybe the very faults we find in others frustrate and aggravate us precisely because we know we have them too.
  
  
  We all have flaws, faults, and vices. There may be a kind of perverse pleasure in picking them out in others. You may enjoy a momentary relief from your own vices by highlighting that theirs are worse. Or you may even have good intentions. You want to help that boss deal with his enormous ego. You want to fix that broken person because that broken person makes you miserable. But as Marcus Aurelius said, “It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.”
  
  
  That’s the essence of Stoicism afterall. Your first job as a philosopher is to distinguish between what’s in your control and what isn’t. Your second job is to expend the full amount of your attention and effort and energy on the things in your control. Escaping and fixing your own faults—that is in your control. And there’s more than enough work to do there to keep you busy for a lifetime. Don’t waste a second getting involved in what others do and say and think. Only what you do.

  Day 17: Make Amends With Someone You’re Holding A Grudge Against
  “We advise a man to regard his friends as highly as himself, to reflect that an enemy may become a friend, to stimulate love in the friend, and to check hatred in the enemy.” — Seneca, Letters From A Stoic, 95.63
  
  Late in his reign, sick and possibly near death, Marcus Aurelius received surprising news. His old friend and most trusted general, Avidius Cassius, had rebelled in Syria. Having heard the emperor was vulnerable or possibly dead, the ambitious general declared himself Caesar and assumed the throne.
  
  
  Marcus should have been angry. After all, this man was trying to usurp his power and possibly take his life. If we think about what other emperors did to their rivals and enemies—Nero killed his own mother; Otho had Galba murdered in 69 A.D. and paraded his head around Rome—it makes Marcus’s response all the more unusual.
  
  
  Because he didn’t immediately set out to crush this man who had betrayed him, who threatened his life, his family, and his legacy. Instead, Marcus did nothing. He kept the news secret from his troops, who might have been enraged or provoked on his behalf—and simply waited: Would Cassius come to his senses?
  
  
  The man did not. And so Marcus Aurelius called a council of his soldiers and made a rather extraordinary announcement. They would march against Cassius and obtain the “great prize of war and of victory.” But of course, because it was Marcus, this war prize was something wholly different. Marcus informed them of his plan to capture Cassius, but not kill him. Instead, he would, “. . . forgive a man who has wronged one, to remain a friend to one who has transgressed friendship, to continue faithful to one who has broken faith.”
  
  
  The great C.S Lewis observed that we all find forgiveness to be a lovely idea…right up until we have someone to forgive. It’s true. Forgiveness is one of those virtues that’s easy to talk about, but incredibly hard to practice. That’s why your challenge today is to forgive one person you’re holding a grudge against.
  
  
  While Marcus’ response to Cassius’ betrayal was remarkable in many ways, it also makes perfect sense. What we see Marcus doing throughout Meditations is exactly what we asked you to do yesterday: taking a long look in the mirror at his own imperfections. He writes about how he wasn’t always great at controlling his temper. And about how he could get better at worrying so much about other people’s opinions. He admits he is sometimes jerked by selfish impulses. He admits that he is self-centered at times, that he does sometimes act hypocritically, he does sometimes do the very things others do that irritate him.
  
  
  Indeed, Meditations could be read as a collection of imperfections, an admission of flaws and shortcomings. That’s probably why it still resonates with millions of us some two thousand years later. And it’s why Marcus didn’t even consider for a second retaliating or holding some grudge against Cassius.
  
  
  Hopefully you experienced it yesterday. When you look at the things you are guilty of—your vices and imperfections—it makes it easier, even instinctual in Marcus’ case, to feel compassion and empathy. It makes it easier to be understanding and forgiving. It makes it easier to see how that person you’re holding that grudge against isn’t evil—they’re human.
  
  
  That’s what Marcus wrote, quite possibly around the time Cassius went rogue. Those people who let us down, who infuriate us, who have a bad temper or a huge ego, who did to us what we believe we would never do to them—“they are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can implicate me in ufliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him.”
  
  
  Nor should you want to. Holding that grudge, bottling up that anger—it’s doing more harm than you’re likely aware of:
  
  According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, the anger from holding on to grudges is like being in a chronic fight-or-flight mode. It disrupts your immune system, increases blood pressure, increases the risk of depression, as well as levels of anxiety and stress.
  
  Forgiveness, on the other hand, works wonders on human health:
  
  In a study published in the Journal of Health Psychology, a team of psychologists tested the relationship between forgiveness and psychological well-being. Study participants had similar levels of accumulated lifetime stress. Surprisingly, for participants with higher levels of forgiveness, their high levels of stress did not impact their mental health. As one of the researchers said of the finding, “We thought forgiveness would knock something off the relationship [between stress and psychological distress], but we didn’t expect it to zero it out.”
  
  When we interviewed Robert Greene a couple years ago about his book The Laws of Human Nature, he talked about it similar to the way Marcus did. He said the primary law of human nature is we all have the same nature. “The truth is we all evolved from the same source, from the same small number of people. Our brains are basically the same. We are wired in a similar way…We all come from the same source…We are all the same.”
  
  
  Then he touched on the Stoic concept of sympatheia—the belief that we are all interconnected, implicated in one another, one and the same. When we internalize that, it’s easier to forgive: The parent who wasn’t there when we needed them. The sibling who embarrassed us. The coach who doubted us. That business partner who cheated us. That manager who stole from us. That mean girl who bullied us all those years ago. That friend who stabbed us in the back.
  
  
  Whoever they are and whatever they did, they are not so different from you. That was Lincoln’s line: they are who we would be under similar circumstances. They deserve your compassion. They deserve your forgiveness. They may even deserve your gratitude—that you did not become who they did.
  
  
  Of the people who injure us in some way, Marcus said there’s only two possibilities. One, their sense of good and evil, right and wrong, is the same as yours. Two, their sense of good and evil is different than yours. In the first case, you have to excuse them. In the second, you have to have compassion for them.
  
  
  “Is that so hard?” he finished. That person who injured you—try to see it. That they’re not so different. That their nature is the same as yours. That you might have done what they did under similar circumstances. That you may have even done something similar. Then, forgive the one who has wronged, remain a friend to one who has transgressed friendship, and continue faithful to one who has broken faith.

### [ Day 18: Stand Up To Something or Someone Bad ](https://dailystoic.com/day-18-nyny2021/)

- Note

  So, first, do not lie. But, second, sitting by and allowing a lie to stand? These can both be injustices. No Stoic would argue that fraud is permissible. But what if you witness fraud? What if you suspect a fraud is occurring at your work or in your industry or in government? Nassim Taleb bridges these two quotes from Marcus perfectly: “If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.”

  Day 18: Stand Up To Something or Someone Bad
  “The upright and honest man corrects the wrongs of Fortune, and softens hardship and bitterness because he knows how to endure them; he likewise accepts prosperity with appreciation and moderation, and stands up against trouble with steadiness and courage.” — Seneca, Letters From A Stoic, 98.3
  
  The modern misconception—that Stoicism is “resignation,” that a Stoic is one who bears the blunt of the awfulness of life, who sits back and rolls with the current state of things, accepting without objection the injustices of the world—would come as a surprise to the many tyrants and oppressors that found themselves in conflict with the Stoics over the centuries. They formed the most ardent “Resistance” to the tyranny of Julius Caesar, Nero, Domitian, Vespasian, and others in the ancient world. 
  
  
  In fact, when you read Tactitus’ history, you almost get the sense that this famously dispassionate observer of history was exhausted by how damn difficult these Stoics were. Why could they just go along with it like everyone else?
  
  
  From Epictetus survives the story of a lesser known Stoic named Agrippinus, who refused to keep a low profile under Nero. Agrippinus liked to say we are all threads in a garment. Under a tyrant, the threads become increasingly indistinguishable as most people compromise and conform, so as to not catch the attention of the capricious and cruel tyrant. To Agrippinus, this kind of compromise, this blending in, this rolling over was inconceivable. He was once asked why he couldn’t just bow down to Nero, why he couldn’t just go along to get along like everyone else. Be another pale thread unclashing with the rest of the garment? No, Agrippinus replied, “I want to be the red, that small and brilliant portion which causes the rest to appear comely and beautiful. Why then do you say to me, ‘Be like the majority of people?’ And if I do that, how should I any longer be the red?”
  
  
  When the Republic was in danger of falling into tyranny, Cato was the red thread. It was Montaigne who wrote admiringly that with Cato’s commitment to principle, “he had to die rather than look on the face of a tyrant.” When the autocracy was established, Cato’s daughter Porcia was the red thread. It was Plutarch who wrote of “her lofty character,” and “still more true is that the daughter of Cato was deficient neither in prudence nor courage.” Under Nero, Rubellius Plautus and Thrasea were the red. Under Vespasian, it was Helvidius Priscus.
  
  
  Perhaps the reason for the misconception we mentioned at the top is that Stoicism is largely about staying out of other people’s personal business. We talked about it at length the last couple of days—this philosophy is about your self improvement. It’s about setting a high standard for yourself. True. But there’s also the belief we mentioned yesterday—we are all interconnected. We push and pull on eachother, Marcus said, “and breathe together, and are one.” He said we are bees of the same hive—injustice done to anyone is injustice done to everyone. Nassim Taleb bridges these two seemingly opposed beliefs—a philosophy concerned with the self and a philosophy concerned with the whole—perfectly: “If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.”
  
  
  In past challenges, we’ve had days where we’ve asked people to do good, to get out in their community and do something that makes it better—volunteer, go for a walk and pick up trash, do yard work for an elderly neighbor. But as a philosophy, Stoicism demands more of us. It calls us to be the person that stands up to corruption and injustice. It calls us to step in when something doesn’t smell right. It calls us to say fraud when we see it. It calls us to be the red. We are calling on you today. Your challenge is to stand up to something or someone bad.
  
  
  Just like in the ancient world, there are big tyrannies and small ones. There are blatant injustices and more subtle ones. There’s Helvidius’ face-to-face clash with Vespasian on the Senate floor. And there’s Agrippinus’ not partaking in banquets and other spectacles put on by Nero. There’s Porcia’s conspiring in Julius Caesar’s assassination. And there’s Thrasea’s abstention from the vote to dignify Nero’s corruption. There’s Stockdale’s seven long years of his constant, almost inhuman resistance in the POW camp. And there’s his speaking the truth on the controversial Tonkin Gulf Incident. 
  
  
  Big or small—the motivation is the same. A Stoic refuses to accept injustice and refuses to be intimidated and resists any and all attempts to force them to do otherwise. A Stoic fights for what is right and never consents to injustice or tyranny. Even if it meant jeopardizing their career, even if it meant losing friends and peers, even if it meant being beheaded or exiled—they stood up for what was right. 
  
  
  Thankfully, it’s unlikely to come to those sorts of things today, but that doesn’t mean we can’t take up their spirit and stand up in our way. Here are some ideas for ways you can stand up to someone or something bad today:
  
  Stand up to or against racism. Maybe you have been ignoring the racist comments of an aunt or uncle on specific—today, you can speak up, firmly and politely. If you see bigotry or hate speech or any kind on social media or in an article or magazine—speak up, leave a comment, send a note to the editor.
  Do The Right Thing. Within your company or business, is there equity and fair treatment? Do people have equal access to opportunities? Is the workplace environment set up to be advantageous for both the employees and the employer? If not—if you are in a position to make changes, make them; if you have been biting your tongue, speak up. 
  Speak The Truth. Politely decline the invitation to that party or wedding and speak up about how the safest option right now is for them to postpone. That family member who still isn’t taking the virus seriously—educate them, try to explain why you’re worried for them, gather and send them the facts. If you see someone putting others at risk, say something. 
  Report It. If you see inappropriate behavior on social media—bullying, harassment, scams, frauds, false information, hate speech or symbols—report it.
  Speak Up. Even if it’s something minor—someone littering or not picking up after their pet or speaking rudely to a waiter or waitress—say something.
  
  “Often,” Marcus wrote, “injustice lies in what you aren’t doing, not only in what you are doing.” History is filled with evidence that humanity is capable of doing evil, not only actively but passively. In some of our most shameful moments—from slavery to the Holocaust to segregation to the murder of George Floyd—guilt wasn’t limited to perpetrators but to bystanders who, for a multitude of reasons, declined to get involved. It’s that old line: all evil needs to prevail is for good men to do nothing.
  
  
  It’s not enough to just not do evil. You must also be a force for good in the world. You must be the red thread.

  Day 19: Find Your 2021 Accountability Partner
  “Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” — Marcus Aurelius
  
  It should be clear by now—the Stoics wanted to be great. They were ambitious. Not in the selfish, insatiable, blindly trying to get ahead kind of way. Their ambitions were more internally focused. It was focused on that lifelong pursuit of virtue, of self-mastery, of wisdom. These were lofty ambitions. And achieving them, the Stoics knew, required help.
  
  
  Seneca said we can strengthen our character, we can strip away faults, we can continually get wiser—but, wisdom cannot cure us entirely. Wisdom, he said, can only tone down our natural weaknesses. It can’t wipe them out completely. “If [wisdom] could rub out all our fault,” Seneca writes, “she would be mistress of the universe.”
  
  
  We can’t help it. We all have those days where the self-control, the discipline, the motivation, the courage to do the hard thing, slacks. Days where we’re too tired or busy or stressed to go for that run, to do our reading, or to wake up early. Says where we have an easier time rationalizing picking up fast food or watching YouTube videos all day or saying “fine” to just one more drink. 
  
  
  But, Seneca said, there is something, or someone rather, who can help us in ways wisdom can’t on those days. “We can get rid of most sins, if we have a witness who stands near us when we are likely to go wrong.” We all need someone in our life to hold us accountable, he said, someone to help us maintain adherence to our lofty ambitions and standards. Today, your challenge is to find that someone, to enlist the help of an accountability partner. 
  
  
  For Seneca, it was Lucilius—the recipient of his 124 letters. This years-long correspondence produced some five hundred pages. For someone explicit in wanting to be remembered as a great writer, we imagine Seneca spawned the idea to begin the correspondence as a way to be held accountable to a writing practice. But, the accountability quickly trickled into all aspects of his life.
  
  
  In his eighteenth letter to Lucilius, for instance, Seneca talks about the effect that just knowing he’d be reporting to Lucilius had on his behavior. It’s the holiday season in Rome, he says, and “the whole mob has let itself go to pleasures.” It’s easy to imagine, Seneca says, himself in previous years doing the same. But this year was different. This year he thought about all the things he and Lucilius talk about—moderation, resisting the downward pull of the group, the guilt that follows cheap pleasures. As he attended holiday festivals and parties, he said it was if Lucilius were there with him “playing the part of an umpire.”
   
  
  
  That’s the power of an accountability partner. They help us live up to our standards. If we talk to them about how we want to live moderately, we’re more inclined to resist temptation. If we tell them we’ll meet them at the gym at 6 a.m. tomorrow, we’re less likely to hit the snooze button. If we know we’re going to be discussing the first three chapters of this or that book with them, we don’t need to find the motivation to read. If we made a pact with them to drink a green smoothie for breakfast every morning, we quickly forget that we don’t particularly love green smoothies.
  
  
  In her book Roman Honor, the historian Carlin Barton talks about how this was “the Tao of the Romans.” There was hardly a government. There was no central police or peacekeeping force of any kind. There was only the Roman censor, who Plutarch describes as a kind of city-wide accountability partner. The censor, he wrote, had “the right to inquire into the lives and manners of the citizens,…to watch, regulate, and punish any tendency to licentiousness or voluptuous habits and to depart from the traditional and established way of living.” 
  
  
  But in essence, Barton explains, people were free to do or not do whatever they wanted. Complete freedom—that’s usually a great recipe for zero self-control and utter chaos. 
  
  
  That Rome not only survived but flourished for so many centuries, Barton says, “was due, above all, to the Roman ‘way,’ the disciplina Romana….[which] demanded a degree of mutual surveillance.” It was a culture built on people holding each other accountable, people pushing each other, people not wanting to let each other down.
  
  
  “There is no one so wild,” Cicero wrote, “as not to be greatly moved…by the fear of reproach.” Nature endowed us, the Romans believed, with a kind of self-governing mechanism, a “body politic.” We seek approbation, Cicero said, and avoid opprobrium. This is why it feels bad when we let ourselves down, but terrible when we let someone else down. It’s why it feels good when we do good, but great when someone acknowledges it. It’s why Rome thrived. And it’s why Seneca said wisdom sometimes can’t keep us from going wrong, but an accountability partner can. 
  
  
  The ancients didn’t use the word “genius” the way we think of it today. It was closer to the word the musician and producer Brian Eno coined “scenius.” It’s a community, a collective, a challenge network like the Scipionic Circle we talked about on day 6. It’s the Lost Generation, the social cohort of expat writers—Ernest Hemingwau, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, among others—that came of age together in Paris after World War I. It’s the Bloomsbury Group of the 20th century, which included Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, and John Maynard Keyes. It’s the Paypal Mafia—Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk. There’s no da Vinci without Verrocchio, no Jobs without Wozniak, no Marcus Aurelius with Junius Rusticus. 
  
  
  “Through philosophy and in the company of philosophy,” Plutarch writes, “it is possible to attain the knowledge of what is honorable and what is shameful, what is just and what is unjust, what, in brief, is to be chosen and what it is to be avoided.” 
  
  
  That’s what we’re all trying to do isn’t it? That’s what Panaetius was trying to do with his Scipionic. That’s what Zeno was trying to do on the Stoa Poikile. That’s why Marcus kept his tutor. That’s why Seneca and Lucilius continued their correspondence all those years. They were discussing philosophy, sharing ideas, exploring Stoicism, challenging each other, pushing each other. 
  
  
  And that’s why we’re doing this work. That’s why we’re studying this philosophy two thousand years later. To become better. We have lofty ambitions. We won’t—no, we can’t—get to where we want to go alone. Find you Lucilius. Find your scenius. Find your accountability partner.

  Day 20: Make Your End Of Life Arrangements
  “And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts. That man is happiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without apprehension. When a man has said: “I have lived!”, every morning he arises he receives a bonus.” — Seneca, Letters From A Stoic, 12.9
  
  Born with a chronic lung condition, Seneca could not help but constantly think and write and prepare for the final act of life. “Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life,” he wrote. “Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s
  
  
  books each day. . .The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.”
  
  
  His greatest insight was correcting the mistake we all make about death. When most of us think about death, we think of it as something that lay ahead of us in the uncertain and hopefully distant future. “This is our big mistake,” Seneca wrote, “to think we look forward toward death. Most of death is already gone. Whatever time has passed is owned by death.” We are dying every day, he realized:
  
  
  We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees; we die every day. For every day a little of our life is taken from us; even when we are growing, our life is on the wane…Counting even yesterday, all past time is lost time, the very day which we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death. It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which previously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself bring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process. We reach death at that moment, but we have been a long time on the way.
  
  
  Seneca’s right. Death is the loss of life. Every passing second is life lost. All of us, right now, are undergoing the death-process. It is the final hour that we fear, that we avoid thinking about, that we do everything we possibly can to push further and further into the future. We have to resist that natural instinct to postpone thinking about the final act. As we’ve been talking about throughout this challenge, we have to do the hard thing. We have to look the uncomfortable truth directly in the face. This, Seneca said, is how we rid ourselves of that crippling fear of death.
  
  
  He compared it to a young kid—when someone they spend every day with “appear with masks on, the boys are frightened out of their wits.” Death is the thing we spend every day with frightening us out of our wits. It’s impossible to fully enjoy life, Seneca wrote, until we “strip the mask.”
  
  
  Today’s challenge is to strip the mask, to embrace the death-process, and to prepare for the moment that merely completes it.
  
  
  The stats reveal that we are largely still making the big mistake Seneca talked about. Almost no one is prepared for life’s final act. Nearly 60 percent of American adults do not have a will. More than half of people die without one. Over a third of U.S. adults have not discussed end of life plans at all. Only 18 percent of people have talked to a doctor or other health care professional about the necessary end of life arrangements. Yet 92 percent of people say talking about end of life plans is important. 80 percent say they want to talk to a doctor or other health care professional about the end of life. More than half of people say they’d be relieved if a loved one started the end of life conversation.
  
  
  To the Stoics, all of life was a preparation for death. As Cicero had said, to philosophize is to learn how to die. As for the man who had written so much on death, Seneca would seize the opportunity in his final act to practice what he had so long preached. When a plot against Nero’s life failed, Seneca put his life on the line to cover for the more active conspirators. Nero then demanded Seneca commit suicide. Not long before, Seneca had written that the proper preparation guarantees us “to be calm as we await that last hour.”
  
  
  Seneca was indeed calm. When Nero’s goons arrived, he made no plea for a pardon. He turned to his friends and said he bequeathed them the only thing that mattered: his example. He then hugged his beloved wife, Paulina, and urged her calmly to grieve for him, to live on without him. He slit the arteries in his arms. His meager diet slowed his blood flow, so next, he called for the poison he’d kept for precisely this scenario. When the poison did not work, Seneca was taken to a steam bath where the heat and dense air finally finished him off.
  
  
  There’s an entire genre of paintings of the death of Seneca. They all show him surrounded by nothing but hysterical friends as he is calm, lean, dignified. “The grave and wise man should not beat a hasty retreat from life,” he had written. “He should make a becoming exit.”
  
  
  Shortly after, his body was disposed of quietly without funeral rites, per a request he’d made long before. Tacitus said it was proof that, like a good Stoic, “even in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of his life’s close.”
  
  
  For Seneca, preparing for the final act, making your end of life arrangements—it was not merely the practical matters like funeral rites, wills, burial plots, DNR orders. He had a simpler—though not easier, to be sure—task in mind when he talks about what it means to be ready to die.
  
  
  “A man has caught the word of wisdom,” he said, “if he can die as free from care as he was at birth.” Remember those circles we talked about on day 13? His observation that life is a collection of large circles enclosing smaller ones? He brings those up again. The size of the circle, he notes, has no affect on the shape. One who is properly prepared for the final act leaves this life exactly the way they came into it. That means they are free, Seneca says. Free from desires, free from fears, fear from treacheries, enemies, faults, debts, secrets, possessions. When “we have jettisoned our cargo of life,” we are ready to round out life’s greatest pleasure.
  
  
  The best part about making these preparations, Seneca adds, is that it is not only the best way to die. It is the best way to live. Free. While it is within no one’s power to live long, this kind of freedom is within the reach of all of us. Strip the mask off death. Strip the cargo.
  
  
  Then, Seneca writes, “go forth as you were when you entered!”

  Day 21: Write Down Your Mistakes From 2020. Burn The List.
  “Everything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way round—you could have right now, this moment. If you’d only stop thwarting your own attempts. If you’d only let go of the past.” — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 12.1
  
  Sometime around the turn of the first century BC, the little known Diotimus made what can only be described as an incredible mistake. He forged dozens and dozens of “licentious letters” that framed the rival philosopher Epicurus—who was enjoying a resurgence in Athens amid the rising splendor and power of Rome. Diotimus portrayed Epicurus as some kind of depraved maniac—a reputation that Epicurus has struggled to completely shed even to this day—in order to bolster his arguments against the philosophy. It was an act of despicable philosophical slander, and Diotimus was quickly brought up on charges.
  
  
  Some accounts say he was executed for this crime, but that seems unlikely. Chances are he was exiled or fined, which is actually more interesting: What does a Stoic do after they make a mistake? What can they do?
  
  
  The answer comes from Seneca, whose own moral failings, his own ambitions and the mistakes he made in the pursuit of them, gave him a keen sense of what people go through after making a mistake. The only thing you can ever do in life, he said, is “look forward to better things.” 
  
  
  What follows a mistake is often regret. And sometimes shame. Or, if we are less self-aware, anger or projection or deflection or denial or blame. We wish things were otherwise, we wish we weren’t such pieces of shit. Or we wish they weren’t. If only we or he or she or they had just…
  
  
  This sort of backward-looking or self-flagellation or blame-seeking—regardless of which category you fall into, they are all the opposite of what Stoicism is about. Stoicism is a lifelong commitment to forward progress, remember? It’s about reducing baggage and excess cargo, remember? It’s about focusing exclusively on what you can control, remember? 
  
  
  When you do something wrong, you can’t go back and undo it. When you write licentious letters of slander, you can’t unwrite them. When you hurt someone, you can apologize, you can say you didn’t mean to, you can say it won’t happen again, but you can’t undo the harm, you can’t unring the bell. When you drop a ball you should have caught, when you’re intercepted on a pass you never should have thrown, when you lose a game you should have won—there’s only one thing you can do. As Bill Belichick famously said, “we’re on to Cincinnati.” We’re turning the page. We’re letting go of the past. Just like we don’t sit around and talk about wins day after day after day, we’re moving forward.
  
  
  That’s how we are going to close out the 2021 New Year New You challenge. Taking a page from the Ecuadorian tradition, Año Viejo, we are going to burn up all the guilt and regret and shame and anger and blame of the past. We are going to rid ourselves of the dangerous accumulation of underbrush and kindling that we’ve begun previous years with. We are going to catalog the mistakes we made in 2020. Then, we are going to burn them. We are rounding out the circle of 2020 and opening a new one on a fresh, clean page. We are moving forward. “We’re on to 2021.”
  
  
  While it does require some looking back, it is important that we get our mistakes down on the page. Seneca said trying to stuff our mistakes away or failing to acknowledge them is like being in a stupor, a kind of deep sleep. “Only he who is awake can recount his dream,” he wrote, “and similarly a confession of sin is proof of a sound mind.” We want to move forward fresher, lighter, sounder. To do so, we have to rouse yourself out of the deep slumber, Seneca said.
  
  
  Maybe you fired off an out-of-character harsh email. Maybe your diet has been terrible since March. Maybe you’re still kicking yourself for working late that night instead of making it to your daughter’s basketball game. Maybe your reputation is still recovering from agreeing to work with that notoriously suspect client. Maybe you just generally weren’t as good a friend or spouse or sibling or parent as you know you want to be. Maybe you look back and realize you let ego or money or external opinion cloud too many decisions in 2020. Maybe you ignored everyone’s advice and took that risk that proved disastrous. 
  
  
  Whatever the mistake and however uncomfortable it is to resurface, get it written on the page. As you do this, be kind to yourself. Again, this isn’t about punishing yourself. On day 17, we talked about how Marcus was forgiving of others because he recognized they were just like him. Well, it goes both ways. When he reminds himself not to “blame the ones who make mistakes” and “to correct them gently” and to “leave other people’s mistakes where they lie”—we imagine he extended that kind of forgiveness to himself. We imagine, after he made a mistake, he reminded himself that he too is only human. Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic, he said, don’t expect perfection. When you make a mistake, correct it gently then leave it where it lies.
  
  
  We’re leaving our mistakes where they lie in a dramatic and cleansing way. As you look at the flames swallowing the page and turning your mistakes to ash, Marcus would say to think about the list of people who felt intense anger or guilt or shame or hatred or whatever. “And ask: where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend…or not even legend.” He’d say to think about how “Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus…Scipio and Cato…Augustus…Hadrian and Antoninus and..everything fades so quickly, turns into legend and soon oblivion covers it.” He’d say to think about how in a world where “all is ephemeral,” only one thing matters: right now.
  
  
  Being a good person and doing the right thing right now. That’s what matters and that’s what was important to the Stoics. Living the life you have as best you can. Remember what Seneca said about all the time that has passed: it is owned by death. The mistakes you made in the past are owned by death. And they are now officially smoke, dust, legend. 
  
  
  We’re on to 2021.
