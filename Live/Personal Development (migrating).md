- [I will not Fear - Litany against Fear (Bene Gesserit)](http://raccourci-minimaliste.com/vous-ne-connaitrez-pas-la-peur-technique-bene-gesserit/)

  
  
  « Je ne connaîtrai pas la peur car la peur tue l’esprit.
  La peur est la petite mort qui conduit à l’oblitération totale.
  J’affronterai ma peur.
  Je lui permettrai de passer sur moi, au travers de moi.
  Et lorsqu’elle sera passée, je tournerai mon oeil intérieur sur son chemin.
  Et là où elle sera passée, il n’y aura plus rien.
  Rien que moi. »
  
  "I must not fear.
  Fear is the mind-killer.
  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
  I will face my fear.
  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
  And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain

## Happiness

### Principles

Live as a Spiritual Warrior: “in Buddhism, one who combats the universal enemy: self-ignorance (avidya), the ultimate source of suffering according to Buddhist philosophy. A heroic being with a brave mind and ethical impulse. Different from other paths, which focus on individual salvation, the spiritual warrior's only complete and right practice is that which compassionately helps other beings with wisdom. This is the Bodhisattva ideal (the "Buddha-in-waiting"), the spiritual warrior who resolves to attain buddhahood in order to liberate others. The term is also used generically in eroticism and self-help literature." 
The four cardinal virtues of the Stoic philosophy are wisdom (Sophia), courage (Andreia), justice (Dikaiosyne), and temperance (Sophrosyne), a classification derived from the teachings of Plato 
Permanent awareness of the daily life details and how they contribute to happiness 
Self-Analysis: Self-introspection to know oneself, but don’t dwell the past 
Do not compare to others 
We are what we think (balance emotions) 
Cannot be happy without the other 
Happiness is contagious Do not forbid the pleasures, but control them carefully. Non-moderated Pleasure often leads to an endless destructive spiral 
Read Theoretical literature. Theory can help us "name" our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences 
Romantism and Spleen got it all wrong?
