## 2 Morning Discipline
- Hot Lemon Water in the morning 
- Meditate actively every morning 
- View from Above: think of whole cosmos and your place within it 
- Mentally rehearse generic Stoic precepts 
- Yogilates, Aiki or Insanity Exercise 
- Rehearse any potential challenges of the day ahead, and the specific precepts required to cope wisely with them. Imagine beforehand the type of things that could go wrong or hinder your plans 
- Periodically contemplate apparent catastrophes such as illness, poverty, bereavement and especially your own death, rehearse facing such calamities with rational composure, in order to overcome your attachment to external things 
- Periodically contemplate the ideal of the Sage, try to put his philosophical attitudes into a few plain words, what must he tell himself when faced with the same adversities you must overcome? Adopt a role-model such as Socrates, or someone whose wisdom and other virtues you admire
## 3 Daily Disciplines
- Mindfulness of the Ruling Faculty: Identify with your essential nature as a rational being, and learn to prize wisdom and the other virtues as the chief good in life. Continually bring your attention back to your character, actions, and judgements, in the here and now, during any given situation. When dealing with externals, be like a passenger who has temporarily gone ashore on a boat trip, keep one eye on the boat at all times (on yourself, your character) and be prepared at any moment to have to return onboard at the call of the captain, i.e., to abandon externals and give your whole attention again to yourself, your own attitudes and actions. In response to every situation in life, ask yourself what faculty or virtue nature has given you to best deal with it, e.g., courage, restraint, etc., and continually seek opportunities to exercise these virtues 
- Indifference & Acceptance: View external things with indifference. Tell yourself: “For me every event is beneficial if I so wish, because it is within my power to derive benefit from every experience”. Accept the hand which fate has dealt you 
- Evaluating Profit: Think of life as a series of transactions, selling your actions and judgements in return for experiences. virtue is always profitable, because it is a reward enough in itself but also leads to many other good things, such as friendship. Accepting that your fate entails the occasional loss of external things is the price nature demands for your sanity (Enchiridion, 12). If the price you pay for external things is that you enslave yourself to them or to other people then be grateful that if you renounce them you have profited by saving your freedom, if upon that you put a higher value 
- Cognitive Distancing. When you are upset, tell yourself that it is your judgement that upsets you and not, e.g., external events or the actions of others. First of all, then, try not to be swept along by the impression but delay responding to the situation until you have had time to regain your composure and self-control. Likewise, when you have the automatic thought that something is pleasurable or desirable, be cautious that you don’t get carried away by appearances, but generally delay your response. Then contemplate together both the experience of enjoying the pleasure and any negative consequences or feelings of regret that are likely to follow; compare this to the image of yourself praising yourself for abstaining from it (Enchiridion, 34). When some apparent misfortune befalls you, consider how you would view it if it befell someone else, e.g., when someone else loses a loved one we might say, “Such things happen in life” 
- Empathic Understanding. When someone acts like your enemy, insults or opposes you, remember that he was only doing what seemed to him the right thing, he didn’t know any better, and say: “It seemed so to him” (Enchiridion, 42). When you witness someone apparently doing something badly, abandon your value judgement and stick with a description of the bare facts of his behaviour, because you cannot know what he did was bad without knowing his judgements and intentions Physical Self-Control Training. Train yourself, in private without making a show of it, to endure physical hardship and renounce unnecessary desires, e.g., practice drinking only water, or when thirsty holding water in your mouth for a moment and then spitting it out without drinking it (Enchiridion, 47). Withdraw your aversion (or desire to avoid) from things not under your control and focus it instead on what is against your own nature (or unhealthy) among your own voluntary judgements and actions (Enchiridion, 2). Likewise, abandon desire for things outside of your control. However, Epictetus also advises students of Stoicism to temporarily suspend desire for the good things under their control, until they have a firmer grasp of these things (Enchiridion, 2). Engage in physical exercise, but primarily to develop your psychological endurance and self-discipline rather than your body 
- Impermanence & Acceptance. Contemplate the transience of material things, how things are made and then destroyed over time, and the temporary nature of pleasure, pain, and reputation. View external things as gifts on loan from the gods and rather than say “I have lost it” say “I have given it back” (Enchiridion, 11). Think of the essence of things, and what they really are. 
- Act with the “Reserve Clause”. At first, rather than being guided by your feelings for or against things (desire or aversion), use judgement to guide your voluntary actions (or “impulses”) toward and away from things, but do so lightly and without straining and with the “reserve clause”, i.e., adding “Fate permitting” to every intention to act upon externals (Enchiridion, 2). 
- Natural Affection (Philostorgia) & Philanthropy. Contemplate the virtues of both your friends and enemies. Empathise with everyone. Try to understand their motives and imagine what they are thinking. Praise even a spark of strength and wisdom and try to imitate what is good. Ask yourself what errors might cause those who offend you to act in an inconsiderate, unhappy or unenlightened manner. Love mankind, and wish your enemies to become so happy and enlightened that they cease to be your enemies, Fate permitting. 
- Affinity (Oikeiôsis) and Cosmic Consciousness. Think of yourself as part of the whole cosmos, indeed imagine the whole of space and time as one and your place within it. Imagine that everything is inter-connected and determined by the whole, and that you and other people are like individual cells within the body of the universe.
## 4 Evening Discipline
- The Retrospective Evening Meditation: Mentally review the whole of the preceding day three times from beginning to end, and even the days before if necessary 
- What done amiss? Ask yourself what mistakes you made and condemn (not yourself but) what actions you did badly; do so in a moderate and rational manner. 
- What done? Ask yourself what virtue, i.e., what strength or wisdom you showed, and sincerely praise yourself for what you did well. 
- What left undone? Ask yourself what could be done better, i.e., what you should do instead next time if a similar situation occurs. Relaxation & Sleep: Adopt an attitude of contentment and satisfaction with the day behind you. (As if you could die pleased with your life so far.) 
- Relax your body and calm your mind so that your sleep is as tranquil and composed as possible, the preceding exercise will help you achieve a sense of satisfaction and also tire your mind.
## 5 Stoic Practices
- Contemplation of the Sage: Imagine the ideal Sage or exemplary historical figures (Socrates, Diogenes, Cato) and ask yourself: “What would he do?”, or imagine being observed by them and how they would comment on your actions. 
- Contemplating the Virtues of Other People: Look for examples of virtues among your friends, family, colleagues, etc. Self-Control Training: Take physical exercise to strengthen self-discipline, practice drinking just water, eat plain food, live modestly, etc. 
- Contemplating the Whole Cosmos: Imagine the whole universe as if it were one thing and yourself as part of the whole. 
- The View from Above: Picture events unfolding below as if observed from Mount Olympus or a high watchtower. 
- Objective Representation: Describe events to yourself in objective language, without rhetoric or value judgements. 
- Contemplation of Death: Contemplate your own death regularly, the deaths of loved ones and even the demise of the universe itself. 
Premeditation of Adversity: Mentally rehearse potential losses or misfortunes and view them as “indifferent” (decatastrophising), also view them as natural and inevitable to remove any sense of shock or surprise. 
The Financial Metaphor: View your actions as financial transactions and consider whether your behaviour is profitable, e.g., if you sacrifice externals but gain virtue that’s profitable but, by contrast, “What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses himself.” 
Accepting Fate (Amor Fati): Rather than seeking for things to be as you will, rather will for things to be as they are, and your life will go smoothly and serenely. 
Say to External Things: “It is nothing to me.” 
Say Over Loved-Ones: “Tomorrow you will die.” 
Cognitive Distancing: Tell yourself it is your judgement that upset you and not the thing itself. 
Postponement: Delay responding to things that evoke passion until you have regained your composure. 
Picture the Consequences: Imagine what will happen if you act on a desire and compare this to what will happen if you resist it. 
Cognitive Distancing: When something upsetting happens to you, imagine how you would view the same thing if it befell someone else and say, “Such things happen in life.” 
Empathy: Remember that no man does evil knowingly and when someone does what doesn’t seem right, say to yourself: “It seemed so to him.” 
Contemplate the Transience of all Things: When you lose something or someone say “I have given it back” instead of “I have lost it”, and view change as natural and inevitable.

	- What Are Your Panic Rules?
		- Copy

		  It’s easy to know what you should do. It’s easy to decide what you want to do. The problem, as always, is that life gets in the way of these well-laid plans. Other people get in the way. Friction, apathy, inertia, indecision—they all get in the way. 
		  
		  Les Snead, the general manager of the Los Angeles Rams, recently that inside the Rams organization they talk about having panic rules. What do you do when everything gets mixed up? When the other team calls an audible, when the coverage is confusing, when the play breaks down and there’s havoc on the field, when the play clock is running down and the play call hasn’t come in yet because the headsets aren’t working.
		  
		  “When there’s chaos and your brain is panicking,” Snead said, “go to your panic rules. Slow down and go to your panic rules.”
		  
		  This isn’t just an on-field thing. As a GM, Snead has to have panic rules too. Like when a player gets in trouble, when there is a controversy, when a tempting high risk, high reward player hits the waiver wire, when somebody wants to renegotiate a contract, when he’s being savaged in the press. If you don’t have panic rules...you’re liable to make panicked decisions. You’re liable to do something emotional, something short term, something that violates your principles and hurts your cause.
		  
		  Stoicism, in theory, is a philosophy. As a practice, it is a set of panic rules.
		  
		   “Just that you do the right thing” is an amazingly pithy and prescient panic rule, straight from the mouth of Marcus Aurelius. “The rest doesn’t matter,” he concluded. He’s saying don’t get distracted, don’t overthink it, don’t be led astray. In the language of football, play to the whistle, stick with your man, know your assignment.
		  
		  “Remember you always have the option of having no opinion.” Another panic rule. Meaning, when things get crazy, you should step back. Wait until you’ve made up your mind before you say or do anything. Don’t just add your judgment on top of things based on reflex.
		  
		  If life was easy and perfect, we wouldn’t need panic rules. But it isn’t. Things are complicated. They go awry. We get mixed signals and we get overwhelmed. When that happens, we must always revert, at once, to our panic rules.
		  
		  The key is to make it really simple. So simple that we can’t screw it up. Then, once we’ve gotten a hold of ourselves and gotten through that down, Les might say, we can huddle up, catch our breath, call the next play, and hopefully do better this time.

		- Notes

		  What Is Stoicism?
		  These perennial arguments caused Greek philosophy to split into four schools of thought. These four schools would then dominate philosophical discourse for more than five centuries… until the Christians showed up and burned everybody’s books.
		  The four schools were:
		  Cynicism
		  Skepticism
		  Epicureanism
		  Stoicism
		  
		  What Stoicism Gets Right
		  
		  1. Focus on things you can control, ignore the rest.
		  2. Accept pain and don’t chase pleasure.
		  3. A good life is a virtuous life.
		  4. Materialism – what is real can be calculated and measured.
		  5. Memento Mori.
		  
		  The Problems With Stoicism
		  
		  1. It is impossible to detach from our emotional reactions and remain rational.
		  2. It is impossible to be entirely rational.

		  Discover for Yourself
		  
		  3. We should give a fuck about some external things.
