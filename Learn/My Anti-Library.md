### Anti-Library
We stand knowledge itself on its head, Taleb says, by becoming anti-scholars—“someone who focuses on the unread books, and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device—a skeptical empiricist.” Someone who has an island of knowledge but focuses on their shore of ignorance. Someone who focuses on that they know only that they know nothing. Someone who never stops questioning. Someone who always stays a student.
