## Why Community Is the New Competitive Advantage
The Unrivaled Scalability of Community
Community Is an Extension of Your Team
The Power of Owning a Topic in People's Minds
The One Thing They Can't Copy
### 1. Membership
- Boundaries. How do people become members, and what are the boundaries keeping others out?
- Emotional safety. By building boundaries and including the right people, you create trust and a feeling of safety.
- A sense of belonging and identification. Members must feel like they fit in and that this is “their community.”
- Personal investment. If members contribute or make sacrifices to the community, it enhances their sense of community.
- A common symbol system. Sharing a symbol like a sports team jersey or a brand logo creates a sense of commmunity
### 2. Influence
Create an environment in your community where members feel like they have a say in what happens
### 3. Integration and Fulfillment of Needs
### 4. Shared Emotional Connection
## The Fundamentals of Community Strategy
### The Three Levels of Community Strategy
1. Business level: How your community program will drive revenue for your company.
2. Community level: How your community will grow and become more healthy and engaged over time.
3. Tactical level: The specific initiatives and improvements you work on in order to build a healthy, engaged community, and achieve the business outcomes.
### The SPACES Model: The Six Business Outcomes of Community
- Support: Customer service and support. The goal is to improve customer support and satisfaction, and reduce support costs by empowering members to answer questions and solve problems for each other.
- Product: Innovation, feedback, and R&D. The goal is to accelerate innovation and improve your product offering by creating spaces for members to share their feedback and discuss ideas that they'd like to see you apply to your product.
- Acquisition: Growth, marketing, and sales. The goal is to increase brand awareness, grow market share, and drive SEO, traffic, and leads, by hosting online and offline community spaces and/or empowering ambassadors to create content, organize events, and advocate on your behalf.
- Contribution: Collaboration and crowdsourcing. The goal is to motivate and accelerate the contribution of content, products, and services on your platform, marketplace, or social network. This is a common objective for companies whose core offering is a community, or is inherently social.
- Engagement: Customer experience, retention, and loyalty. The goal is to increase customer retention, average contract value, and customer satisfaction by giving customers a sense of belonging and organizing engaging and valuable community experiences.
- Success: Customer success and advancement. The goal is to make customers more successful at using your product, resulting in increased spend, retention, and satisfaction, by empowering them to teach each other, help each other skill up, and grow in their careers.

Metrics and the Attribution Challenge: Goal vs Metrics
Finding Your Community Focus: It's important to focus on just one or two primary objectives for your community program
Growth Engines vs. Cost Centers
Choosing a Measurement Framework: OKR, 4DX, V2MOM
### The Community Investment Journey
1. Seed. The community is first started and needs a lot of love and care to keep it alive.
2. Growth. There's community-market fit and the community starts to organically grow and engage.
3. Maturity. The community becomes well-established, with clear norms and leadership structure.
4. Pollination. The community becomes so large that it breaks out into peripheral or subcommunities, that become their own seed stage communities and move through the cycle while still under the umbrella of the broader, more mature community.
## Creating a Social Identity
### The Social Identity Cycle
1. Identification. The person identifies with the community and is attracted to the social identity of the group.
2. Participation. The person takes some sort of action to participate in a community experience
3. Validation. Participation is rewarded in some way, making them feel good about their participation, which strengthens their investment in the shared identity, and the cycle repeats.

Over time, with consistent participation, the community member will move through three levels of identity which are laid out in the social identity theory:
1. Social categorization. We see ourselves as being in the same general category as the community (e.g., I like baseball and live in New York so I'll start watching Yankees games).
2. Social identification. We see ourselves as a member of the group and start to adopt the shared identity (e.g., I am a Yankee fan and will wear Yankee gear to represent my fanhood).
3. Social comparison. We identify so strongly that we start comparing our in-group to out-groups and tie our self-esteem to the status of our group (e.g., I care deeply about the success of the Yankees, and despise the Boston Red Sox).
### Who Is Your Community Built For?
- People: Who are we?
- Purpose: What do we believe?
- Participation: What do we do?

When in Doubt, Get More Specific
Look for the People Who Feel Isolated
Who Doesn't Belong?
What Is Your Community's Personality?
How Can You Make Your Members Feel “Cool”?
Should Your Community Have a Unique Identity from Your Company Brand? Another big question for companies thinking about their community identity is whether they should build community around their existing brand and product identity or create a unique brand identity just for their community.
Finding Sub-Identities within Your Community. Examples:
- Contribution level. Focus on your most active users, or most loyal customers. Focus on your biggest markets, or the industries where members have the biggest need for community
- Location. Focus on members who live in specific regions where you have critical mass
- Demographics. Focus on members with common age, gender, race, or other attributes 
Defining Identity by Levels of Contribution:
1. Passive members
2. Active members
3. Power members
4. Leaders
##  Mapping the Community Participation Journey
The Commitment Curve
The Four Levels of Participation
Creating Intentional Barriers to Entry
Designing a Compelling Onboarding Experience:
1. What do you want them to know? (Vision)
2. What do you want them to feel? (Welcome)
3. What do you want them to do? (Intro and first steps)

##  Validation, Rewards, and Incentives
Creating Habits with Rewards:
- Cue
- Routine
- Reward
Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Motivations
Avoid Replacing Social Norms with Market Norms
SNAP! A Framework for Effective Extrinsic Rewards:
- Status: Social status sits at the heart of community. We join communities where we see an opportunity to improve our status among a group that we care about. We tend to leave communities when there's no more status to gain or we've lost status and don't feel we can gain it back.
- Networking: Create experiences that help your members meet and interact with the right people who will be interesting and useful to them
- Access: When your community members are users of your product, they'll be invested in how your product changes and evolves over time. They want to feel like they have influence over the direction of your business.
- Perks

##  Designing Community Spaces and Experiences
The Two Kinds of Community Experiences: Synchronous vs Asynchronous
Most great communities I've seen have a combination of both. They offer asynchronous spaces for members to connect every day, get answers to questions, and engage in discussions. Then they'll complement those spaces with live events and gatherings where members get to interact in-person or virtually over video.
Asynchronous experiences provide breadth. Synchronous experiences provide depth.
Repetition, Repetition, Repetition (create recurring experience): Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly rituals/events
The 7Ps of Community Experience Design:
- People. Who are we gathering?
- Purpose. Why are we gathering?
- Place. Where are we gathering?
- Participation. What will participants do?
- Policy. What are the rules and guidelines?
- Promotion. How will you invite members?
- Performance. What will success look and feel like?
