	- Notes

	  Supporting. Connecting. Cohering. Resolving. Balancing. Listening. Translating. Absorbing.
	  
	  If so, there is a good chance you have a view of your organization that no one has (not even the CEO). You see and hear things most people don't see. You are taking on an emotional burden that most people don't take on. And you are shouldering an emotional burden that often goes unrecognized and unappreciated...and unpaid
	  Take care of yourself. I’ve personally tried to do equal amounts self-care and integrator work.
	  Connect with yourself. What is the wolf behind your tree? Why are you drawn to put yourself in the messy middle of the org?
	  Realize you are not alone. There are many integrators out there (read this thread)
	  Be realistic that integrators are not formally rewarded. And ask how might you change that? Are you working with integrators that have not been formally rewarded?
	  How can you elevate the profile of underrepresented groups in your org that take on the burden of integration work?

  People don’t buy products, they buy better versions of themselves 
  The common practice of forcing users to walk through a tutorial immediately after signing up, before they have a chance to explore the product themselves, is an example of breaking that momentum. And in addition to getting in the user’s way, it doesn’t actually help them learn the product. “You’re also essentially trying to get them to learn through rote memory by showing them instead of having them learn by doing,” 
  Instead, he prefers progress trackers that recommend specific features to explore or tasks to complete. LinkedIn’s “profile strength” meter, which displays your progress towards completely filling out your profile, is an example. He’s also a big fan of examples, such as the empty projects that populate the accounts of new users of the project management application Basecamp, which can help them get a sense of what they can do with a tool and how to use it 
  Also helpful: simply telling customers why they should do something. For example, Zepeda says that telling Switchboard users that they are twice as likely to succeed on the site if they upload a photo made uses far more likely to do so
  
- [20180101d - How to show customers the value of free:](https://blog.intercom.io/successful-free-trials)

  The first step to successful free trials is knowing what “success” is for your customers. Once you’ve asked them that, you have to ensure you have targeted help, support, docs, tutorials and case studies to help them succeed. Finally you need a picture of what failure looks like, and once you see the tell-tale signs you need to step in to prevent it 
  Implementing all of this correctly isn’t easy. But get it right and when it comes to decision time, instead of hearing phrases like: “It’s too expensive”, “We don’t have that kind of budget”, you should be hearing “Did exactly what I need”, “Cheap at half the price” and “How did I do this before”. And that’s the sound of success

  It’s strange how forward-thinking and patient we can be when it comes to planning our product, but how hard it is to do the same when we talk about our companies, their cultures and their organization. We’re great at scoping and prioritizing the next big features, but when we see something we think needs to change internally all that thinking and planning gives way to frustration that things are moving too slowly. And when we do finally change our organizations, it’s painful. It’s like working on a gigantic feature and shipping it all at once, rather than a little at a time. It’s untested, unproven and an enormous delta from what came before because we waited so long to act. How many times have you felt the palpable fear and nervousness and even anger in a room of your peers while an executive described a new org structure they’ve been planning in secret for the last six months? At BuzzFeed, we recently when through a reorganization of the product development team. The planning was already well underway by the time I arrived in January, but the interesting part was that, while the group planning it was necessarily small, they took great care to keep the entire product dev team informed

	- Notes
	  I’ve said multiple times that Amazon has the foundation for a great remote-first company. The document-based process provides employees in multiple timezones the same context as someone in Seattle. The discussions in meetings enable faster feedback loops, but the downside is they can limit the potential for asynchronous engagements if notes and questions aren’t captured in the document.
