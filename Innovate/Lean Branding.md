# Framework Summary
Graphics are just one part of the complex stories that customers build when they think of you or your product. There’s much more to your brand than a logo. A brand is the unique story that consumers recall when they think of you. It associates your product with your customers’ personal stories, a particular personality, your promise to solve a given problem, and your position relative to your competitors. Your brand is represented by your visual symbols and feeds from multiple conversations where you must participate strategically. Consumers are hesitant, anxious, aspirational, plural, ever-evolving beings looking to protect, improve, and communicate who they are and want to be. Successful brands listen.

There are several reasons to start building your brand today. Refusing to recognize the importance of branding will only hurt you: everyone can make your brand inferior in your absence. You will find that developing a strong brand reaps rewards far beyond simple awareness: price premiums, a strong sense of direction for your company, a competitive edge, and a creative license to test novel products

# Brand Storyboard
## Once upon a time:
In this scene, you will describe the buyer personas introduced earlier in this chapter using images or text. Who is the main character in your brand story?
## He/she always: 
Define some of the main tasks that your customer is regularly involved with. What does she do every day? What are her main responsibilities in life and work, as related to the product or service that you offer?
## But always had a problem
State the main issue that your customer faces when trying to complete her tasks. What is the unsatisfied need or aspiration in this story?
## He/she tried to solve it:
If the previous problem is real, your customer is probably already solving it. What are some alternate solutions to the issue at hand? How is your customer managing to partially satisfy this aspiration?
## But he/she wished that
Outline the flaws in the solutions your customer is currently using. Despite purchasing these other products or services, your customer is still unsatisfied. What are existing solutions lacking?
## Until one day
Describe how your customer will most probably learn about your brand. What happened on the day she first heard about you?
## Unlike his/her solution, this
List some of the aspects related to your product experience that set you apart from competitors. How does your offer differ from your customer’s current solution?
## His/her wish came true, to:
Clearly define the aspiration that your brand fulfills. What is your customer’s “wish come true”?

Now that you have filled out each of these scenes, consider some of the implications of each of your answers. Why do they matter? How can we use them? Why are they important for brand building and conversion?

# 1 Brand Story
Digital channels are just tools to show (what should be) a meaningful brand story
## Brand Story Part - Customer Asks - Customer Really Thinks
- Positioning - "How are you useful to me?" - WHY should I buy from you?
- Promise - "What do you promise to do for me?" - Why SHOULD I buy from you?
- Personas - "What do I need/want from you?" - Why should I buy from you?
- Personality - "Who are you?" - Why should I buy from YOU?
- Product - "What will you offer, over time?" - Why should I BUY from you?
- Pricing - "How much is this going to cost me?" - Why should I BUY from you?
## 1. Name
Look around. What names are your competitors using to brand their products? (Write at least 20)

What word or words encompass the most important thing your product is here to change? (Jot down a list of at least 20)

Go literal: write down words commonly used in the industry that you’re in, the type of product you’re trying to sell, and the people who will buy it

Sometimes we only think of nouns (i.e., things), but there’s actually a vast list of verbs (actions) and adjectives (descriptors) that are great sources for names: Dropbox (verb+noun), GoodReads (adj+noun), etc

Go figurative: use metaphors; find ideas that are related to the experience that you are creating

Which of these words (or combination of words) could best convey what your product does? (Narrow it down to 10)

Which of these options is most original and therefore recognizable in the marketplace?

Which of these options can be trademarked and does not interfere with another company’s legal rights?

- Tools: Tagline
## 4. Personas
Activities are goal-directed sets of actions—paths towards things people want to accomplish. What are the modes people work in, and the specific activities and processes they go through?

Environments include the entire arena where activities take place. What is the character and function of the space overall, of each individual's spaces, and of shared spaces?

Interactions are between a person and someone or something else; they are the building blocks of activities. What is the nature of routine and special interactions between people, between people and objects in their environment, and across distances?

Objects are building blocks of the environment, key elements sometimes put to complex or unintended uses (thus changing their function, meaning and context). What are the objects and devices people have in their environments and how do they relate to their activities?

Users are the people whose behaviors, preferences, and needs are being observed. Who is there? What are their roles and relationships? What are their values and prejudices?

Go out and learn cautiously from what your buyers say, and rigorously based on what they do.
